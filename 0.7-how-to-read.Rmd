## How to Read {-}

Read the text in any format below. But this digital-first book (with interactive maps, videos, and source links) is best experienced in the web edition (http://ontheline.trincoll.edu).

- Web (recommended)
- PDF
- ePUB
- MOBI
- DOCX

Several images **will not appear in the PDF/ePUB/MOBI/DOCX versions** until after this book-in-progress is completed.

The web interface also offers these reading options:

- Menu
- Search (in-progress)
- Font (adjust text size and display)
- Edit (suggest edits or comment; requires free [GitHub](http://github.com) account)
- Download
