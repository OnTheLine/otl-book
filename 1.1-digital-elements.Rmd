**Test endnotes**

If you are holding this book in your hands, via a device or on paper, or looking at it on your desktop, you might wonder why we feel it necessary to even ask the question. It is important at the outset to make the argument that digital archaeology is not about 'mere' tool use. Andrew Goldstone in _Debates in the Digital Humanities_ discusses this tension [@goldstone_teaching_2018]. He has found (and Lincoln Mullen concurs with regard to his own teaching,[@mullen_confirmation_2017]) that our current optimism about teaching technical facility is misplaced. Tools first, context second doesn't work. Alternatively, theory first doesn't seem to work either. And finally, for anything to work at all, datasets have to be curated and carefully pruned for their pedagogical value. We can't simply turn students loose on a dataset (or worse, ask them to build their own) and expect 'learning' to happen.
