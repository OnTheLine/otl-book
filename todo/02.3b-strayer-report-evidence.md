reassert weak (or mixed) suburban school quality: see how Burpee 1928 describes (or fails to describe) H, WH, B, A school quality
 The overall weak link between school quality and residential location in the city of Hartford????.
During the 1920s-30s in Hartford and suburbs, the geographical relationship between school quality and housing price was relatively unimportant for white families; or it did not matter as much as it would in later decades. Based on available reports, school quality did not vary consistently with income or social class of neighborhood. Race, of course, was a different story. . .
Hartford’s unusual spatial distribution of residential wealth described in 19030621HC Merriam Hartford sociology slums essay -- “Hartford is computed one of the richest cities of its size in the country. This wealth, however, is highly scattered.” Insurance assets total over $200 million but “local wealth is not so large and available as the statistical aggregates might seem to indicate.” Also, “another notable thing in Hartford is that hte residential section of the wealthier citizens is not segregated but unusally scattered in different parts of the city, so that local interests and responsibility for social enterprise are manifest even if not always exemplified.”
IF FEASIBLE, describe and map housing values in H and WH neighborhoods:  TO DO: show either 1930 census or 1930/40 property values by neighborhood unit for Hartford and West Hartford; show relative distribution

Design notes: untitled
Design notes: Not yet sure what data to map yet, but looking for some way to demonstrate that neighborhood property values were not as tightly linked to public school quality measures in early 1900s. Need to make sure that there is a comparison map in 2000s at end of book, perhaps by average home sales price and CMT score.

At secondary level:
o	DOES THIS FIT?: Most prestigious HS curric was HPHS, center of pageantry in 1930s, but had far lower facilities rating than Bulkeley and Weaver HS
Why the weak link between school quality and housing price?
•	Relatively few students completed secondary schooling, not yet strong upward mobility pathway with intense competition to enter?? 
•	??elem-jhs-hs “feeder” pathways not yet clearly established??
•	Out-of-district admissions still permitted, based on tuition, so not tied to geography????
Role of testing in admissions?? Not tied to geography?
In 1930s, the definition of “quality school” was tied first to the building (and then to expenditures); but the definition did not yet consider “outcomes” like test results.......(???)
 Look for elem school maps of facility ratings to see if pattern exists between locality and quality (at first glance, I don’t think it’s there, except for Arsenal at low-end of both scales) 
** See “HPS Survey 1936 Tables.xls” for a comparison of Elem School facility ratings and HS pct enrolled (via district)
**Need more work to make direct comparison of Elem school facility score with Property value and race; ask Emily to statistically compare following:
-- 1936 survey data on elem school facility ratings  (physical quality)
-- 1936 survey data on HS pct enrollment  (outcome quality)
-- 1939 WPA map on rental property value by block (property value)
-- 1939 WPA map on racial charcteristics by block (to sep white v black results)

 The weak links between student achievement and neighborhood residence in the 1920s suburbs. Back in 1923 (chart 2), test scores had little relationship to spatial location. East School students during morning session A scored above the district average, while those attending the afternoon session B scored below it. At Seymour School, the results were essentially reversed: session B students met the district average, while session A fell below it.


Hartford claims:
•	At elem level: 
o	Compare Strayer elem school ratings with 1940 income census data (or 1939 WPA block avg rental data map)
o	Noah Webster mid-level rating, and slow action, confirms point: 19371015HC  letter to editor notes that Noah Webster Elem still has auditorium named as fire hazard in Survey; is same district wehre Mayor Spellacy and Board of Ed Pres Berman live
o	Exception is Arsenal -- see “locality” quote; 19380402HC  Indeed, predom Black neighborhoods had lower quality school facilities (Arsenal example?). 
WH School supt Bugbee planned ahead for future school sites, using town zoning and development maps, and latest data on children per family, to identify the ideal location and size of future schools. -- 19280413HC WH plans future school sites
 Sam Bass Warner’s question about suburbanization: did the construction of infrastructure precede or follow significant movement into a subdivision?

Design notes: untitled
Design notes: How did housing developments alter suburban space? Dual-window map locations of housing development sites (labeled, with dates) and aerial views of changing land-use patterns. Can we connect this to sewer line development and public school construction in selected suburbs? Ideally, we might be able to acquire muncipal GIS parcel files from WH, Bloomfield, etc. with a “year constructed” variable, and create animated map of “development” appearing over time.
