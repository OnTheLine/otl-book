Why write an open-access book?

The goal of the book is to make hidden boundary lines more visible,
Therefore, making the entire book more visible, more transparent, also fits..


The book showcases some original research that my students and I have conducted, some of which has been previously published in academic journals and book chapters that are not easy to physically or virtually access, because they are typically purchased by academic libraries and require library cards, or more often passwords to enter the network.
Furthermore, like most academic writing, some of these journal articles and book chapters are not accessible for general readers because they contain theoretical frameworks, methodological jargon, or lengthy literature reviews that were written with the goal of gaining acceptance and tenure by the academic world. To be clear, I agree that writing a persuasive argument for other scholars matters as a way to advance our knowledge. But writing solely for scholars does not fulfill our broader mission of educating our students and the public.

Therefore, I'm writing this book in the same tone as I teach my undergraduates. The prose is designed for thoughtful people, but those who do not necessarily have any background in this subject.
It fulfills the spirit of the recent NEH initiative for publicly accessible books (*cite)
And although NEH has not yet joined other federal funders (such as the goverment-funded National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health) in requiring its recipients to publish grant-funded work as open access, it seeks to set the bar and demonstrate how humanities and social science scholars can produce open-access peer-reviewed books with cooperating publishers.

My current fellowship at Wesleyan University, where I am teaching a seminar on school and housing choice, and invited talks at Amherst, Hamilton, and Swarthmore, demonstrate a broad interest in these topics at leading liberal arts institutions.

Finishing On The Line took longer than expected for two reasons. First, I author text relatively slowly, drafting and then redrafting every chapter, paragraph, and sentence. Second, the process of writing history with digital evidence on the open web was so revolutionary in my experience that I co-edited/co-authored three other books on the way toward creating this one. . .

I expected primarily because I'm a slow author, and secondly because I co-edited or co-authored three other books about the process while a


as my Trinity colleague Jason B. Jones reminds me, "Lean Open."

I decided that the best way for me to tell this story is to freely share it online. After experimenting with a self-published preview edition of this book in 2011, I discovered how open-access academic publishers, such as the University of Michigan Press, successfully distribute peer-reviewed books into two formats: print (for sale) and online (for free). For a time I set aside this project to co-edit two related volumes—Writing History in the Digital Age and Web Writing—that broadened my experience and thinking about open-access scholarly publishing.[1]

On the open peer review process, which generated about 1,000 comments in both of the edited volumes, see "Conclusions" in Writing History in the Digital Age, and "Introduction" in Web Writing.

On The Line almost did not turn out this way. Early in the process, an academic press offered a book contract to produce a digital edition, but could not guarantee it would be accessible by public libraries, which was a deal-breaker.
Explain more about two obstacles. . .
We agreed not to sign a contract
Fortunately, I'm such a slower writer that my ideal technology and publisher caught up with me. . .




A new generation of web tools, many of them produced by open-source developers, made it possible for us to act on this dream. Key sources are embedded in the text when appropriate, and the prose is written to realize this learning potential.

In one sense, this book offers a response to the MOOC madness that has swept through higher education
MOOCs have challenged residential liberal arts colleges: some on bandwagon, some resistant
My residential liberal arts college recently jumped on the bandwagon, and paid $250,000 for the privilege to freely distribute selected mini-course content on the edX platform.
The arguments in favor of MOOCs are noble: make elite higher education (or at least a facsimile of it) freely available to all
Colleges also are driven by self-interest:

What I don't think many liberal arts colleges will readily grasp is that:
1) we're competing outside of our areas of strength. Research universities have greater economies of scale to generate free courses with higher production values. Stanford's edX courses will always look glitzier than those offered by small liberal arts colleges. It costs money to compete with Stanford.

By contrast, think about what residential liberal arts colleges do well, and how to leverage this in an open-access digital world.
We teach students how to think, research, and write clearly, how to investigate meaningful questions and tell why the answers matter to diverse audiences.

Overall, On The Line is a book that blends the best features of the web. . . ( repeated from About the book). . .. In recent years, pundits have proclaimed that higher education will be revolutionized by the MOOC, or the massive online open course. Liberal arts colleges often feel pressured to respond to these changes, but unsure exactly how to do so in ways that build upon our strengths as small communities of highly-engaged teachers and learners. Perhaps On The Line represents another strategy: let's "flip the MOOC" by authoring open-access books, freely available on the web, co-authored with our liberal arts students and recent graduates, that reach outward and pull readers into the narrative with digital elements. .
[Visual: flip the MOOC into a BOOK this way:
MOOC
WOOC
BOOC
BOOK
Perhaps we can even coin a new buzzword for what to call these open-access scholarly publications. How about "Body Of Open Knowledge" -- or maybe just a "BOOK" for short. Or maybe it looks better spelled in lowercase "book" -- as long as we reconsider the possibilities of what a book can be. . .

Print vs Digital?
This book offers a test case for exploring debate over print versus digital. And it's one that I worry about, as an author and educator, who recognizes potential of digital-first scholarship but also wonders about unseen consequences of our decisions on student learning.

- about recent studies of reading comprehension and memory in print vs digital books, and what we still need to learn

But potential of digital book: free, findable, and can take people in new directions. . . this is not a textbook to be memorized, but rather a tool for broader learning

Decided to ask my students what they thought about while reading, and whether they preferred print or digital versions
