# Mapping and Publishing *On The Line* {#mapping-publishing}

This chapter details our design process and web technologies we used to create this open-access digital book. Our interactive maps and charts, built with open-source code libraries such as Leaflet and Chart.js, help broader audiences to visualize spatial and historical change over time. The chapter also describes our publishing workflow, based on the open-source Bookdown package for RStudio, which produces both HTML web pages and PDF print pages. We share our knowledge about these tools so that others may innovate and build more digital books to tell their own stories.
