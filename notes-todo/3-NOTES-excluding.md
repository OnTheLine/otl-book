## NOTES on Excluding Through Zoning Lines

TODO: in discussion about Jewish neighborhood, add photo of Hartford tenement from 1903 report (negative, without people), and CTDA image of neighborhood peddlers (more positive, with people) in order to make stronger connection to anti-apartment view. Caption something like... In the early 1900s, photographs of Hartford's multi-family tenements appeared in both muckraking housing reports (without people) and more positive street scenes (with people, such as residents of this Jewish neighborhood). Both images represented the type of multi-family housing (and its lower-income residents) that suburban town leaders sought to avoid through exclusionary zoning.

TODO: ADD in two places -- jobs and homes -- Joseph E. Klau, “Oral History Interview by Joseph D. Hurwitz” (Jewish Historical Society of Greater Hartford, April 17, 1974), recalled middle-class Jews moved into 2 and 3-family housing developments along Albany Avenue while "The poor Jews still lived in the Third Ward" in 1910s-20s, cited in Hutton p. 12. Klau's interview does not yet appear in online oral history collection.

born 1902 in NY, raised in Hartford tenements, Front Street and South End; HPHS; socialist; Democrat; Harvard undergrad and law school; moved back to Hartford to find a job as a lawyer in 1927: "I went for all of them, knocking on doors. You couldn't know on any, nobody was taking in a Jew as their [lawyer] in Day, Berry and Howard [or] Robinson, Robinson, and Cole. They do that now but not then." so he got a job with a small firm run by Charlie Sadarski who said "you can take care of all of the cases that come into the office that have got nothing to do with mortgages, I'll handle those" p13

about Jews moving further west on Albany Ave in Hartford in 1920s: Describes how farmland on Albany Avenue from Brooks St to Vine St was sold to developers "and every little Jewish builder was given a lot and a construction loan. And the two and 3 family houses went up like mushrooms...  It was the first modern housing that we had with central heating and electric lights, and real bathrooms... that was a tremendous concentration of Jews, of middle class Jews in what politically was the 4th and 12th wards of Hartford. The Barbour Street area, the Bellevue Street area, was the 3rd Ward which the poor Jews still lived in and the blacks were coming into it." p14 Referring to more luxury homes, "you really had to be pretty wealthy to live on Westbourne Parkway"p14



TODO: context of governmental power over private property in 1920 CT Supreme Court ruling Windsor v Whitney:
Eminent domain takes private property because it is useful to the public.
Legislature gave town of Windsor ability to plan layout of streets and eminent domain.
"Streets of reasonable width add to the value of the land along the street, enhance the general value of land and buildings in the neighborhood and greatly in- crease the beauty of the neighborhood. These are all facts of universal knowledge....Public Acts of 1917, Chap. 349 (General Statutes, §§ 391-396). These statutes indicate the legislative conviction that acts such as these are within the legitimate exercise of the police power. Narrow streets in congested industrial centers breed disease. Too many houses crowded upon a lot without sufficient space for light and air menace health. Such a neighborhood affects the morals of its people." p365
"The State is vitally interested in the health of its citizens, for upon their strength rests its own well-being. It or its agent, the town, must provide fire and police protection to all settled parts. The State and its agent, the town, can- not preserve and protect the rights committed to it if private owners may lay out streets at will and build at will. Uniformity in plan or relation of one street to others will be absent. The practical loss to the community will be large and the loss in neighborhood appearance will be immeasurable." p366

TODO: Is Zoning Racist? (chapter conclusion)....
Today, nearly a century after West Hartford and other Connecticut towns approved their first zoning ordinances, many question whether or not zoning is racist. This conflict arises in heated debates like this one in Woodbridge, where a coalition organized by the Open Communities Alliance submitted an application to construct multi-family housing, and have threatened legal action if the town does not approve it (and others)..
"Residents and some of the zoning commissioners have expressed outrage that those asking for zoning overhaul are describing the town as racist.
“You[r application] essentially called Woodbridge a bunch of racists,” town commissioner Paul Schatz said in February."
But fair-housing advocates make a distinction between the *intent* versus the *impact* of a law. While zoning rules were originally intended to avoid referring directly to people's race, religion, or nationality, the minimum-land requirements have a direct impact on the racial composition of the town, because White families tend to be wealthier...
"The team from the Yale clinic and Open Communities Alliance, however, has said the town has had decades to do the right thing — and that its inaction has had an impact on who can live in Woodbridge. While not explicitly racist, the zoning rules are having a disparate impact on Black and Latino people, they said."
“Woodbridge’s zoning restrictions over the decades have driven up housing costs, and these high costs exclude many Black and Hispanic families and keep Woodbridge whiter and wealthier than the surrounding region. And so, when Woodbridge stays the same, Woodbridge stays segregated,” Anderson said. “It doesn’t have to be this way.”

When looking back at the *intent* of zoning in 1920s Connecticut suburban towns like West Hartford, there's strong evidence of *exclusionary* goals.... keeping out apartment buildings like those in the city, and the lower-income people who rent them....  zoning was a powerful legal tool to physically and socially distance neighborhoods by wealth, to separate the *haves* from the *have-nots*. In the context of 1920s suburban Connecticut, zoning also aligned with contemporary anti-Jewish and anti-immigrant views of dominant White Protestants....  But there was no explicit nor implicit language about using zoning to keep Black families out of suburban Hartford towns in the 1920s, because Black migration was still a distant White fear in the future, not the on-the-ground reality of their time.... The City of Hartford had less than X % Black residents in 1920, and most of them were segregated into tenements along the Connecticut River, far from the West Hartford border, where only X Black residents lived....
But zoning prevailed as an exclusionary tool not only because it did not mention color or creed, but because its *coded* targets of exclusion evolved over the decades.... and it became a powerful yet "color-blind" means of preventing lower-income Black, Puerto Rican, and White families from moving into the town in future decades....[transition to next chapter?]

TODO DECIDE if this is worth adding: Manville's interpretation: "R1 first proliferated after the Supreme Court struck down racial zoning in 1917’s Buchanan v. Warley decision. Buchanan made single-family mandates appealing because they maintained racial segregation without racial language. Forcing consumers to buy land in bulk made it harder for lower income people, and therefore most non-White people, to enter affluent places. R1 let prices discriminate when laws could not (Trounstine, 2018; Weiss, 1987). Contemporary observers denounced this regime of backdoor segregation, but in 1926 the Supreme Court upheld it. In Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co. (1926), the court tacitly excused R1’s implicit racism by validating its explicit classism. Cities could prohibit apartments, the court said, because apartments were nuisances: “mere parasites” on the value and character of single-family homes. In Euclid’s wake, R1 became a quiet weapon of the White and wealthy in their campaign to live amid but not among the non-White and poor (Danielson, 1976; Rothstein, 2017; Trounstine, 2018)." ^[@manvilleViewpointItTime2019, p. 2]





TODO West Hartord pop growth in comparison to other towns/region/ct -- see chart from 1950 TPA Wethersfield


TODO: Insert how lower-court ruling acknowledged (and approved of?) racial & anti-immigrant motivations behind zoning, and rules against city of Euclid. On appeal....

TODO: Imagine how zoning policies reshaped economic incentives using 1920s prices.....
SHOW typical parcel land costs and total home costs on Ardmore Road?
SHOW zones on top of aerial image to show how relatively small areas allocated for duplexes in C zone (Ardmore Road) versus single-family homes in A-B zones nearby...   


TODO -- Check CS Lib, Gen Assemb Committee on Cities and Boroughs, minutes about zoning hearing or votes around Apr 14 1923 HC; May 16, 1923 HC; May 29, 1923 HC.  Did Josiah Woods or West Hartford Zoning Commission initially propose the bill?
