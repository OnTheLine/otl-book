## NOTES on Excluding Through Zoning Lines

TODO: in discussion about Jewish neighborhood, add photo of Hartford tenement from 1903 report (negative, without people), and CTDA image of neighborhood peddlers (more positive, with people) in order to make stronger connection to anti-apartment view. Caption something like... In the early 1900s, photographs of Hartford's multi-family tenements appeared in both muckraking housing reports (without people) and more positive street scenes (with people, such as residents of this Jewish neighborhood). Both images represented the type of multi-family housing (and its lower-income residents) that suburban town leaders sought to avoid through exclusionary zoning.

TODO: ADD in two places -- jobs and homes -- Joseph E. Klau, “Oral History Interview by Joseph D. Hurwitz” (Jewish Historical Society of Greater Hartford, April 17, 1974), recalled middle-class Jews moved into 2 and 3-family housing developments along Albany Avenue while "The poor Jews still lived in the Third Ward" in 1910s-20s, cited in Hutton p. 12. Klau's interview does not yet appear in online oral history collection.

born 1902 in NY, raised in Hartford tenements, Front Street and South End; HPHS; socialist; Democrat; Harvard undergrad and law school; moved back to Hartford to find a job as a lawyer in 1927: "I went for all of them, knocking on doors. You couldn't know on any, nobody was taking in a Jew as their [lawyer] in Day, Berry and Howard [or] Robinson, Robinson, and Cole. They do that now but not then." so he got a job with a small firm run by Charlie Sadarski who said "you can take care of all of the cases that come into the office that have got nothing to do with mortgages, I'll handle those" p13

about Jews moving further west on Albany Ave in Hartford in 1920s: Describes how farmland on Albany Avenue from Brooks St to Vine St was sold to developers "and every little Jewish builder was given a lot and a construction loan. And the two and 3 family houses went up like mushrooms...  It was the first modern housing that we had with central heating and electric lights, and real bathrooms... that was a tremendous concentration of Jews, of middle class Jews in what politically was the 4th and 12th wards of Hartford. The Barbour Street area, the Bellevue Street area, was the 3rd Ward which the poor Jews still lived in and the blacks were coming into it." p14 Referring to more luxury homes, "you really had to be pretty wealthy to live on Westbourne Parkway"p14



TODO: context of governmental power over private property in 1920 CT Supreme Court ruling Windsor v Whitney:
Eminent domain takes private property because it is useful to the public.
Legislature gave town of Windsor ability to plan layout of streets and eminent domain.
"Streets of reasonable width add to the value of the land along the street, enhance the general value of land and buildings in the neighborhood and greatly in- crease the beauty of the neighborhood. These are all facts of universal knowledge....Public Acts of 1917, Chap. 349 (General Statutes, §§ 391-396). These statutes indicate the legislative conviction that acts such as these are within the legitimate exercise of the police power. Narrow streets in congested industrial centers breed disease. Too many houses crowded upon a lot without sufficient space for light and air menace health. Such a neighborhood affects the morals of its people." p365
"The State is vitally interested in the health of its citizens, for upon their strength rests its own well-being. It or its agent, the town, must provide fire and police protection to all settled parts. The State and its agent, the town, can- not preserve and protect the rights committed to it if private owners may lay out streets at will and build at will. Uniformity in plan or relation of one street to others will be absent. The practical loss to the community will be large and the loss in neighborhood appearance will be immeasurable." p366

TODO West Hartord pop growth in comparison to other towns/region/ct -- see chart from 1950 TPA Wethersfield


TODO: Insert how lower-court ruling acknowledged (and approved of?) racial & anti-immigrant motivations behind zoning, and rules against city of Euclid. On appeal....

TODO: Imagine how zoning policies reshaped economic incentives using 1920s prices.....
SHOW typical parcel land costs and total home costs on Ardmore Road?
SHOW zones on top of aerial image to show how relatively small areas allocated for duplexes in C zone (Ardmore Road) versus single-family homes in A-B zones nearby...   


TODO -- Check CS Lib, Gen Assemb Committee on Cities and Boroughs, minutes about zoning hearing or votes around Apr 14 1923 HC; May 16, 1923 HC; May 29, 1923 HC.  Did Josiah Woods or West Hartford Zoning Commission initially propose the bill?

TODO -- when zoning chapter is online, ask Fairfield author if his scholarship is public, as I would like to cite it



TODO -- SEE MINUTES of Town Council meetings

- December 1922 re: Fred Kenyon
- March 6, 1923: WH town council reports that corporation counsel Carlyle C. Thomson and attorney John T. Robinson will defend town building inspector against legal proceedings by Goldberg's attorney. Also, J.B. Woods of the town commission favors a zoning act to protect the residential character of certain sections
- July 17, 1923: zoning commission named

TODO: See WH Property records for more accurate dates when households bought and occupied homes on Ardmore Road in 1920s

TODO: Play the Zoning Game: aka Tetris for Real Estate Developers: What Kind of Housing Do the Rules Motivate You to Build?
- rules: costs for land, costs for home type, typical sale prices
- undeveloped land (graph paper or digital grid), house size requirements (cut-outs or moveables)
- is there a SimCity with this type of detail?
- ask developer of JS simulations... see name in GitHub or Zotero prior to pandemic?
