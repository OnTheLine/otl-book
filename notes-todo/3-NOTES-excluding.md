## NOTES on Excluding Through Zoning Lines

TODO: add more about "why zoning matters" to intro chapter before going into historical narrative

    Why did zoning not happen earlier in these towns?
    - zoning infringed on individual rights of residents to use property as they wish, a core principle in rural comm.
    - but as rural towns experienced rapid real estate development, they adopted suburban governments that traded individual rights for group protection against threats of urban life, such as apartment buildings with lower-income outsiders to their community

    Why did zoning matter?
    - zoning is built into the environment; once zoned for single-family homes, and those are built out, hard to make change
    - zoning by local government inherently protects the interests of current residents, not interests of the metro region or the state in providing affordable housing opportunities for all residents...

    In contrast to overt discrimination, towns like Avon [and WH?] began to exercise more subtle means of exclusion and homogenization through legal tools of zoning, taxation, and services. According to Downs, "...all suburbs have one major advantage regarding cultural homogeneity that is not shared by larger cities: suburban residents can make use of legal machinery to maintain their homogeneity by excluding those who may change it. Of course, they cannot directly prevent any particular group from entering by passing discriminatory laws but they can set up and enforce specific standards regarding building quality, tax rates, the character of public services, and the nature of the school system. By raising these standards high enough, they can make it economically impossible for 'disrupting' elements to enter the area and dilute the homogeneity which they seek to establish" p315 (quoted in Ladd, Ideology in America), source: Anthony Downs, "Metropolitan Growth and Future Political Problems." Land Economics 37 (1961): 311-20.

     Unlike other tools developed around the same time (such as racially restrictive property covenants that prohibited non-white residents, and have since been outlawed by civil rights legislation), wealth-based zoning remains perfectly legal today. But it does nothing to promote the health and safety of the citizenry, as promised by the original intent of the state law.


TODO: decide whether to shift description for West Hartford from "exclusionary zoning" to "segregated zoning" because they did allow some multi-family housing, but physically separated it from their desired goal of single-family housing

TODO: make sure this concept appears in either 3.1 or 3.2:  Zoning advocates of the 1920s never used the phrase *exclusionary zoning* when laying out their plans with minimum-land rules.....

TODO: Insert simple Avon-Bloomfield-West Hartford-Hartford mini-map to guide reader

TODO: Imagine how zoning policies reshaped economic incentives using 1920s prices.....
SHOW typical parcel land costs and total home costs on Ardmore Road?
SHOW zones on top of aerial image to show how relatively small areas allocated for duplexes in C zone (Ardmore Road) versus single-family homes in A-B zones nearby...   

TODO -- when zoning chapter is online, ask Fairfield author if his scholarship is public, as I would like to cite it



TODO -- SEE MINUTES of Town Council meetings

- December 1922 re: Fred Kenyon
- March 6, 1923: WH town council reports that corporation counsel Carlyle C. Thomson and attorney John T. Robinson will defend town building inspector against legal proceedings by Goldberg's attorney. Also, J.B. Woods of the town commission favors a zoning act to protect the residential character of certain sections
- July 17, 1923: zoning commission named

TODO: See WH Property records for more accurate dates when households bought and occupied homes on Ardmore Road in 1920s

TODO: Play the Zoning Game: aka Tetris for Real Estate Developers: What Kind of Housing Do the Rules Motivate You to Build?
- rules: costs for land, costs for home type, typical sale prices
- undeveloped land (graph paper or digital grid), house size requirements (cut-outs or moveables)
- is there a SimCity with this type of detail?
- ask developer of JS simulations... see name in GitHub or Zotero prior to pandemic?
