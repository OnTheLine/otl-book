## NOTES on Excluding Through Zoning Lines



TODO: add that Woods/WH were motivated primarily by maintaining/raising property values, since attracting higher-wealth residents to their town would raise the value of taxable property (grand list), and keep tax rate lower for everyone. While they did not define their zoning policies as "exclusionary" that was the foreseeable outcome....

TODO: compare Whitten/West Hartford exclusionary strategy with less-divisive plan from Wethersfield 1928 by Swan, which had less restrictive zoning
Also note how anti-tenement view is expresed as public health benefit
schools section refers to Wethersfield zoning areas already adopted:
A at 9 families per acre
B at 18 families per acre
for calculating projected school enrollment, it uses A and shows lack of space in future
Zoning section describes how zoning cannot do everything (prevent shacks; aesthetic issues), so will need to rely on restrictive covenants (referring to aesthetics, not race)

TODO: context of governmental power over private property in 1920 CT Supreme Court ruling Windsor v Whitney:
Eminent domain takes private property because it is useful to the public.
Legislature gave town of Windsor ability to plan layout of streets and eminent domain.
"Streets of reasonable width add to the value of the land along the street, enhance the general value of land and buildings in the neighborhood and greatly in- crease the beauty of the neighborhood. These are all facts of universal knowledge....Public Acts of 1917, Chap. 349 (General Statutes, §§ 391-396). These statutes indicate the legislative conviction that acts such as these are within the legitimate exercise of the police power. Narrow streets in congested industrial centers breed disease. Too many houses crowded upon a lot without sufficient space for light and air menace health. Such a neighborhood affects the morals of its people." p365
"The State is vitally interested in the health of its citizens, for upon their strength rests its own well-being. It or its agent, the town, must provide fire and police protection to all settled parts. The State and its agent, the town, can- not preserve and protect the rights committed to it if private owners may lay out streets at will and build at will. Uniformity in plan or relation of one street to others will be absent. The practical loss to the community will be large and the loss in neighborhood appearance will be immeasurable." p366

TODO West Hartord pop growth in comparison to other towns/region/ct -- see chart from 1950 TPA Wethersfield


TODO: Insert how lower-court ruling acknowledged (and approved of?) racial & anti-immigrant motivations behind zoning, and rules against city of Euclid. On appeal....

TODO: Imagine how zoning policies reshaped economic incentives using 1920s prices.....
SHOW typical parcel land costs and total home costs on Ardmore Road?
SHOW zones on top of aerial image to show how relatively small areas allocated for duplexes in C zone (Ardmore Road) versus single-family homes in A-B zones nearby...   


TODO -- Check CS Lib, Gen Assemb Committee on Cities and Boroughs, minutes about zoning hearing or votes around Apr 14 1923 HC; May 16, 1923 HC; May 29, 1923 HC.  Did Josiah Woods or West Hartford Zoning Commission initially propose the bill?

TODO -- when zoning chapter is online, ask Fairfield author if his scholarship is public, as I would like to cite it

TODO DECIDE if this is worth adding: Manville's interpretation: "R1 first proliferated after the Supreme Court struck down racial zoning in 1917’s Buchanan v. Warley decision. Buchanan made single-family mandates appealing because they maintained racial segregation without racial language. Forcing consumers to buy land in bulk made it harder for lower income people, and therefore most non-White people, to enter affluent places. R1 let prices discriminate when laws could not (Trounstine, 2018; Weiss, 1987). Contemporary observers denounced this regime of backdoor segregation, but in 1926 the Supreme Court upheld it. In Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co. (1926), the court tacitly excused R1’s implicit racism by validating its explicit classism. Cities could prohibit apartments, the court said, because apartments were nuisances: “mere parasites” on the value and character of single-family homes. In Euclid’s wake, R1 became a quiet weapon of the White and wealthy in their campaign to live amid but not among the non-White and poor (Danielson, 1976; Rothstein, 2017; Trounstine, 2018)." ^[@manvilleViewpointItTime2019, p. 2]

TODO -- SEE MINUTES of Town Council meetings

- December 1922 re: Fred Kenyon
- March 6, 1923: WH town council reports that corporation counsel Carlyle C. Thomson and attorney John T. Robinson will defend town building inspector against legal proceedings by Goldberg's attorney. Also, J.B. Woods of the town commission favors a zoning act to protect the residential character of certain sections
- July 17, 1923: zoning commission named

TODO: See WH Property records for more accurate dates when households bought and occupied homes on Ardmore Road in 1920s

TODO: Play the Zoning Game: aka Tetris for Real Estate Developers: What Kind of Housing Do the Rules Motivate You to Build?
- rules: costs for land, costs for home type, typical sale prices
- undeveloped land (graph paper or digital grid), house size requirements (cut-outs or moveables)
- is there a SimCity with this type of detail?
- ask developer of JS simulations... see name in GitHub or Zotero prior to pandemic?

TODO: Ask Beth: Joseph E. Klau, “Oral History Interview by Joseph D. Hurwitz” (Jewish Historical Society of Greater Hartford, April 17, 1974), recalled middle-class Jews moved into 2 and 3-family housing developments along Albany Avenue while "The poor Jews still lived in the Third Ward" in 1910s-20s, cited in Hutton p. 12. Klau's interview does not yet appear in online oral history collection.

## TODO RESEARCH NOTES on expanding exclusionary zoning

- secondary sources: (Mackie book on Avon “General Plan of Development” 1954; etc.)
- town council meeting minutes/notes/news accounts that created zoning boards above
- town zoning board minutes/notes/news accounts during their early years of hearing cases
- public hearings on zoning bills at the CT Gen Assembly
