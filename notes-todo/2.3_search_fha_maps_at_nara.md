# FHA maps at National Archives, College Park

looking for FHA Neighborhood Ratings Maps of Hartford, if they exist

RG 31 Cartographic for Hartford CT
https://catalog.archives.gov/id/208156484
Manuscript and photostat maps, including block-data and analytical maps from the Real Property Inventory and maps prepared for the Housing Market Analysis of Hartford and surrounding towns, showing growth of populations, types of residential areas, and number of dwelling units authorized by building permits.

I already downloaded FHA Block Data Maps of Hartford

I *think* I reviewed these years ago and would have noticed FHA Neighborhood Ratings Maps if they were present

Excerpt from my 2006 & 2010 notes at National Archives:
RG 31 FHA in Cartographic had various WPA maps of Hartford (and Bridgeport), and the most interesting one was the following:
RG 31: Records of the Federal Housing Administration, 1930 - 1965, folder 40 (Connecticut)
	Block Data Map, City of Hartford, Real Property Inventory 4 May 1939, WPA Project 665-15-3-141
	had b&w photocopy made, and used color pencils to copy in approp colors
Also, skimmed through preliminary inventories for RG 207 HUD (and its predecessors, and saw references to urban renewal, model cities applications, but nothing that really grabbed my interest for CSS project)

2024 NARA replied that someone would need to review documents in person

Dear Mr. Dougherty,
This message is in response to your recent inquiry to the National Archives at College Park regarding RG 31 city maps. Your inquiry was forwarded to me for a reply.
We searched the Cartographic Branchâ€™s holdings and found records that appear to be responsive to your request.
There are more maps left for Hartford than we are able to scan on demand, so in order to access the remaining maps you'll need to visit the archives in College Park, MD in person. You can pull those maps using the citation: RG 31, Real Property Maps, Hartford, CT.
