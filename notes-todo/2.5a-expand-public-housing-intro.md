EXPAND intro - USE Coates Reparations idea in intro or conclusion: "In 1948, when the Supreme Court ruled that restrictive covenants, while permissible, were not enforceable by judicial action, Chicago had other weapons at the ready. The Illinois state legislature had already given Chicago’s city council the right to approve—and thus to veto—any public housing in the city’s wards. This came in handy in 1949, when a new federal housing act sent millions of tax dollars into Chicago and other cities around the country. Beginning in 1950, site selection for public housing proceeded entirely on the grounds of segregation. By the 1960s, the city had created with its vast housing projects what the historian Arnold R. Hirsch calls a “second ghetto,” one larger than the old Black Belt but just as impermeable. More than 98 percent of all the family public-housing units built in Chicago between 1950 and the mid‑1960s were built in all-black neighborhoods."

ADD more background on public housing in Hartford:
Many young people today are surprised to hear of a time when "public housing" was a highly desired commodity by Whites. . . Go back to 1940s/50s when housing was scarce. . . Many called for government to intervene in the private housing market by creating more publicly-funded affordable housing. . . Successful because these efforts were tied to wartime industry. . .(check and cite Picture Windows book)

Public housing communities often were racially segregated . . .

Most suburban towns were reluctant to allow the federal government to build public housing inside their municipal boundaries. . . and when this did happen during wartime, local leaders and residents fought the federal rules to keep Af-Ams out. .. . [transition into Oakwood Acres story]
