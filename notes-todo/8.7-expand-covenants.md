## How We Found Restrictive Covenants {- #covenants}
*by [Katie Campbell Levasseur, David K. Ware, June Gold, and Jack Dougherty](authors.html)*

Our **[Restricting with Property Covenants](restricting.html) chapter in this book** was inspired by several public history and advocacy projects across the U.S, including several now organized as the [National Covenants Research Coalition](https://www.nationalcovenantsresearchcoalition.com). One of the earliest to launch online was the [Segregated Seattle project](https://depts.washington.edu/civilr/segregated.htm) in 2005, where researchers found White-only and anti-Jewish covenants in tens of thousands of properties across King County and Washington State. Their public history work pushed state legislators to approve a 2006 law to encourage homeowners to strike out racist covenants in the public record, and a 2023 law to provide compensation for victims.^[@NationalCovenantsResearch2022. The earliest digital history project on racial property deeds probably was @plotkinRacialReligiousRestrictive2015, which states that content was posted online prior to 1999. On Seattle and Washington State, see @gregorySegregatedSeattle2006 and @civilrightsandlaborhistoryconsortiumuniversityofwashingtonRacialRestrictiveCovenants2023.]

This chapter outlines different strategies for finding race restrictive covenants in Connecticut. Our methods vary by the type of land records available in each town clerk's office, and our methods also changed over time as more (but not all) documents from the past have gradually been digitized. When possible, we recommend consulting with local experts who have more experience, such as property lawyers and professional title searchers, and to learn from methods advanced by members of the [National Covenants Research Coalition](https://www.nationalcovenantsresearchcoalition.com). We share our experiences to encourage readers to search their own local property records, build public awareness of how racism shaped our communities, and to advocate for policies that promote justice in housing.

### From Oral Interviews to Printed Records {-}
One method to finding racial covenants is to start with oral interviews and trace leads back through printed property records. When Katie Campbell and Jack Dougherty began searching in West Hartford in 2010, we began with anecdotal accounts by long-term residents that we attempted to confirm in the Town Clerk's property records. But we faced several obstacles. First, the town clerk's land records room contained over 4,000 print volumes of land transaction documents, with partially-organized paper indexes but few digitized records at that time. Second, we had no legal training nor experience with title searching, so we read accounts of what other researchers had done elsewhere and tried to apply it to our local context. Third, no one in our small circle of Hartford-area civil rights activists, attorneys, or town officials had ever seen a restrictive covenant in the Hartford region, so we didn't know exactly what to look for or whether we would actually find one. Due to the overwhelming size of the task at that time, we limited our search to property records in West Hartford, the largest suburb bordering the City of Hartford, and did not attempt to look elsewhere.

Tracey Wilson, the West Hartford town historian and history teacher, gave us leads for possible covenants from anecdotal accounts by long-term residents while writing her monthly history column in the *West Hartford Life* periodical. Our most specific lead came from Mary Everett, who described in our history interview how she bought a home at 30 Ledgewood Road around 1970, when her lawyer mentioned that the property included a racially restrictive covenant from the 1940s that was no longer enforceable.^[@everettOralHistoryInterview2011]

Working backwards with property records, we traced the real estate transaction from the 1970s to the original deed in the 1940s. When conducting our research in 2010, the Town of West Hartford had recently made available a public online property assessment database, which allowed searches by name or address, but with transactions only into the 1970s. Our search for Mary Everett (or her spouse, Ronald) pointed us to a 1970 warranty deed in book 474, page 185, available only in print volumes in the property records room. This 1970 deed referred to the printed book and page numbers for prior transactions. By tracing the trail backwards in time, we finally found the original 1940 deed for the High Ledge Homes subdivision, which included this race restriction: "No persons of any race except the white race shall use or occupy any building on any lot except that this covenant shall not prevent occupancy by domestic servants of a different race employed by an owner or tenant." Also, the entire High Ledge Homes subdivision appeared on a wall map in the property room, which referenced a 1938 subdivision surveyor's map number 222, stored separately on microfilm in the town clerk's office. By matching up past and present maps, we geographically confirmed that 30 Ledgewood Road was constructed on building lot #78, one of the 84 parcels of land specifically restricted by the racial covenant in the original 1940 subdivision deed, described in the video in Figure \@ref(fig:2011-covenants-video).^[@campbellHowWeFound2011; @highledgehomesinc.AgreementConcerningBuilding1940]

(ref:2011-covenants-video) In this [2011 video](https://player.vimeo.com/video/220562166), Katie Campbell Levasseur describes how we traced restrictive covenants in paper property records in the Town of West Hartford town clerk's office.

```

We also tried to widen our search by skimming paper indexes of real estate transactions in the Town of West Hartford's property records room. For example, a print volume called the *Grantor Index Corporate Pages* listed transactions by grantor (seller) to grantee (buyer) in partially alphabetical order by years during the racial covenant period (roughly 1920s through 1940s). We searched for listings labeled as "agreements" and inspected those by volume and page to see the deed between parties included any restrictions. Using this approach, we identified about 200 deeds listed as agreements, and among those we found 22 agreements that included some type of restriction, all between 1933 and 1949. (We determined that before 1933, searching for "agreements" was not a productive way to look for restrictions, because we found restrictions in deeds that were not listed as having "agreements".) As a result, we found two types of restrictions on property deeds between 1915 and 1950, which we labeled *value* and *race*. Value restrictions were more common than race restrictions. Value restrictions typically stated that the owner could not build a home below a certain square footage, or below a minimum price (such as $5,000 in the 1920s), in an effort to maintain higher property values. But race restrictions stated that the land could not be occupied by non-White people, except for domestic servants. In some cases, deeds combined the two types. In either case, individuals or developers used these restrictions to control the social class and/or racial composition of a neighborhood, and its relative price in the minds of prospective wealthy White buyers.

Looking back, over the past decade the partial digitization of West Hartford records makes the job somewhat easier today, but still requires searching print volumes to reliably trace sales back into the 1940s. First, the [Town of West Hartford Online Assessment Database](https://gis.vgsi.com/westhartfordct/Default.aspx) offers name and address search, but ownership history is currently incomplete prior to the 1970s. Second, the [Town of West Hartford Land Records portal](https://www.westhartfordct.gov/town-departments/townl-clerk/land-records) offers search by name, date, and book-page number (not consistently by address or parcel number), but many document images are still not available online, and lands records are incomplete prior to 1963. Searching by paper is still necessary for land records in this town at this point in time.

In sum, while our 2010 study of West Hartford was not exhaustive, we located race restrictive covenants in 5 subdivisions that included about 190 parcels of land in the early 1940s. We estimate about 6 percent of West Hartford homes built during this period had restrictive covenants, given around 3,020 buildings were constructed in town during the 1940s. We count the entire decade because developers did not successfully sell homes on every parcel during the Depression and World War. In 2012 we placed scanned PDFs of all historical documents and digitized subdivision boundaries in an interactive Google Map, hosted by the University of Connecticut Libraries Map and Geographic Information Center. In 2017, we migrated historical documents and geodata into our [GitHub public repository](https://github.com/ontheline/otl-covenants/) and displayed them in our [open-source Leaflet map](https://ontheline.github.io/otl-covenants/index-caption.html).^[See table calculations, historical documents, and map code in @ilyankouMapRaceRestrictive2017]

**WAIT ON THESE PARAGRAPHS**

Starting with anecdotal accounts of restrictive covenants produced mixed results, which perhaps tells us something about *historical memory* and how people believe they remember the past. Both during and a decade after our research, we heard some White West Hartford residents describe their memories of anti-Jewish or anti-Catholic restrictive covenants on their homes, yet still have not found documents supporting claims about their specific properties, nor any religious-based covenants in West Hartford as of this writing. For example, in two 2021 publications about the history of segregation in West Hartford, Mayor Shari Cantor recalled that her home on Colony Road "actually had a restrictive covenant and did not allow Jewish people." But when tracing back the paper records, we found no documentation of any restrictive covenant on her property. Yet other residents agree that Jewish homebuyers were excluded from that neighborhood, as surnames listed in late 1950s city directories appear to confirm.^[Shari Cantor recalled anti-Jewish restrictive covenants on her home at 39 Colony Road, West Hartford, in a video oral history for @napervilleheritagesocietyWestHartfordConnecticut2022, and a journalist interview in @puttermanWestHartfordMostly2021. See discussion of Jewish exclusion and 1958 city directory evidence in @wilsonHowSegregationHappened2019. For more anecdotal accounts of anti-Jewish and anti-Catholic covenants that we could not confirm with documents, see @wilsonTakingStockHigh2010. Wilson wrote: "By word of mouth I had heard that in the 1930s and 1940s and into the 1950s, no Roman Catholics could live on Stoner Drive, the first street developed on 'the mountain.' No Catholics could buy on Wood Pond or Sunset Farms. According to another resident, the address of a house on the corner of Foxcroft Road and Fern Street was changed to Fern Street because no Jews were allowed on Foxcroft Road." But we could not find property records to confirm any of those 2010 claims.]

How do we explain this difference between historical memory versus documents? One interpretation is that homeowners might be confusing different causes of housing segregation. Rather than a restrictive covenant (which would appear in a property deed), perhaps Jewish homebuyers were excluded by a neighborhood association agreement (which might exist on paper, but not filed as a property record with the town government), or more likely the real estate agents who refused to show property to outsiders (which may have been openly discussed, but not documented on paper). A second interpretation is that White homeowners might wish to identify with opponents of segregation rather than its proponents. When Mayor Shari Cantor described her personal experience with housing discrimination to a journalist in 2021, she did so in the context of defending her gradualist approach to affordable housing policy in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. As the journalist wrote: "Shari Cantor, West Hartford’s mayor, says she understands her town’s history of discriminatory housing practices, noting that the house she lives in once held a restrictive covenant. Today, she says, she hopes to create a more inclusive town--- but is wary of any housing policy that might risk residents' property values."^[@puttermanWestHartfordMostly2021]

### Search Full-Text Historical Newspapers {-}
Another strategy to locate racial covenants is to search for keywords in full-text historical newspaper databases, which may lead to news stories or real estate ads with clues to trace back in the property records. For example, in our 2010 research for racial covenants in West Hartford, we searched the full-text *Hartford Courant* historical newspaper, at that time a newer 2005-era technology available through our Trinity College library subscription to the ProQuest database, and now more widely available through the [ResearchIT CT portal](https://researchitct.org) with any Connecticut public library card. By searching for "restrictive" and "covenant" and related terms, we found 1947 news accounts about Simon Bernstein, a Hartford lawyer and Democratic city council member, who wrote a public letter asking the state legislative Judiciary Committee to invalidate race- and religious-restrictive covenants. The *Hartford Courant* White daily newspaper ran a short excerpt of Bernstein's letter, which mentioned an unnamed nearby town where a property deed restricted its sale "to only non-semitic members of the Caucasian race." Later our search of Library of Congress historical newspapers led us to the *Hartford Chronicle*, a Black weekly newspaper, which published Bernstein's full letter. Six decades after Bernstein wrote his letter, we were very fortunate to conduct an oral history interview with him at age 98. He clearly recalled a different racial covenant case he was involved in as an attorney, regarding the Mountain Road area of West Hartford, which was settled out of court. But without sufficient details, we never found any documentation about either covenant seen by Bernstein.^[Compare the excerpt versus the full letter in @BernsteinSeeksEnd1947; @bernsteinLetterEditor1947, and see also @bernsteinOralHistoryInterview2011. *Hartford Courant* historical newspaper searches are now publicly available through @connecticutstatelibraryResearchITCT. Learn more about @HartfordChronicle1940 and related newspapers, publicly available through @uslibraryofcongressChroniclingAmericaHistoric]

More recently, we have had more success searching for clues about restrictive covenants in newspaper real estate ads from the early 20th century across Connecticut. Purchasing an individual subscription on the [Newspapers.com](https://www.newspapers.com/) platform allowed us to do full-text searching of multiple newspapers across the entire state, though many papers still have not yet been digitized. For example, by searching for key phrases --- such as "wisely restricted" or "reasonable..." or "sensible..." or "proper restrictions" --- we found several Connecticut real estate advertisements that openly publicized euphemistic prohibitions, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:2024-newspapers-search). These code words sometimes led us directly to anti-Black and anti-Jewish prohibitions in the town land records. Another advantage of searching the Newspapers.com database is its wider inclusion of *Hartford Courant* local and regional editions for suburban and rural towns, compared to the ProQuest database that sometimes includes only the city edition.^[@ancestry.comNewspapersCom]

### Search Subdivision Maps {-}
Another strategy to locate restrictive covenants in Connecticut focuses on how housing developers converted large landholdings into subdivisions for individual homes, and the maps they created in that process. When retired attorney David Ware searched for racial covenants in suburban Manchester in 2020, he went to the Town Clerk's office and began looking at surveyor's subdivision maps, submitted by developers for town approval from the 1910s through the 1950s. Depending on the town, original paper subdivision maps may be stored in large flat drawers, or they may have been microfilmed or digitized into an online database. Typically, these maps identify the seller of the property, the person or corporation subdividing it into smaller lots for home sales, perhaps a name they gave to the development, and the year, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1940-manchester-greenway-map).^[See 1940 Greenway Park map from Town of Manchester CT property records, in @ilyankouMapRaceRestrictive2017]

```{r 1940-manchester-greenway-map, fig.cap="(ref:1940-manchester-greenway-map)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/1940-manchester-greenway-map.png")
```

In Manchester during the early 1940s, Ware found that developers of larger housing subdivisions, meaning 30 or more residential lots, were more likely to add *uniform restrictions* in property deeds for sales to builders or homeowners to maintain consistency and property values across a neighborhood. A list of uniform restrictions might prohibit shacks, trailers, and nuisances to other neighbors, and it might also include racist covenants. While smaller subdivisions are not necessarily free from racial prohibitions, Ware found it more efficient to start with larger subdivisions. The next step is to search by name of the property seller in the "Grantor Index" for the years during and after the creation of the subdivision, and often there are multiple entries for owners or developers selling smaller lots for individual homes. Grantor Index entries usually include a brief description of the property (such as the development name and lot number), the date, and most importantly, the town clerk's record of the deed by volume (or book) and page number. If the developer added a racial covenant, it will appear in the deed on this volume and page, and subsequent property transfers will refer back to this deed. For large subdivisions, it's wise to check at least two or more individual lot sales to confirm the presence of racial covenants. Based on his research, Ware recommended that Connecticut create a simpler process for current homeowners to void racial covenants in their property records, which was unanimously approved by state legislators and signed by the governor in 2021, as described in the [Restricting chapter](restricting.html) in this book.^[@wareBlackWhiteGreenway2020]

### Search Digitized Property Records {-}
When retired attorney and educator June Gold learned in 2023 about racial covenants in Hamden, a suburb of New Haven, she began investigating property records and free legal services to help current homeowners remove them, as described in the [Restricting chapter](restricting.html) in this book. Searching for covenants became easier here than most towns because the Hamden clerk contracted with a private service to digitize most land records from 1778 to the present, and make them publicly viewable online, primarily for attorneys and title searchers working on present-day real estate transactions.

Gold's strategy for searching digitized property records has several advantages, but it's important to begin with key constraints. First, while Hamden's online records are robust, there currently is no "full-text" search capability, meaning that ordinary users cannot yet easily search across thousands of scanned property deeds for keywords or phrases found in race restrictive covenants, such as "the white race" or "non-semitic" persons. (But land record digitization services most likely have the technology to enable full-text searches, as described further below.) Second, digitized property records are typically organized to search by names of sellers and buyers (grantors and grantees), date, and volume and page number---but typically not by street address (or parcel number) for more than five decades ago. So searching for racial covenants still requires hunting backwards in time, from the current owner to prior owners, and skimming pages of original property deeds for any restrictions.   

When Gold searches Hamden property records online, sometimes she begins with the name and address of a current homeowner who recalled hearing about a racial covenant in their property deed when they purchased their home and signed closing paperwork with an attorney. Beginning with the buyer's name, Gold traces back the transfer of ownership---sometimes multiple transactions over time---through volume and page references to prior property deeds back to the original, as shown in FIGURE TODO  

2024-hamden-property-name.png

After locating a racial covenant on one property, Gold traces the paper trail of neighboring homes, especially those located in the same subdivision, since many developer's maps also have been digitized in the town property records, as shown in FIGURE TODO. When Gold finds the name of one developer with a racial covenant, she searches that name to check if they created other subdivisions with similar covenants. Sometimes Gold also searches for similar property documents (such as an "agreement" or "warranty deed") in the same or adjacent volumes to where she has already located one racial covenant. Furthermore, sometimes she studies maps of suburban homes to identify the geographic outlines of likely 1920s-50s subdivisions to hunt for possible covenants.

2024-hamden-property-map.png

Another online tool Gold uses is Hamden's online property assessment database (sometimes called assessor records), primarily created to track current owners and the appraised value of their property for taxation.  TODO ADD LINK. While online assessor records may only go back a few decades in Connecticut towns, most platforms allow searches by owner name and street address, which helps Gold inform present-day homeowners about racial covenants placed on their home in past. For example, if a 1940s subdivision developer added a racial covenant to all properties on Carmalt Road, the assessment database allows Gold to lookup current owners' names and addresses to contact them about their opportunity to renounce racism.
