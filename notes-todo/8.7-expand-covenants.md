## How We Found Restrictive Covenants {- #covenants}
*by [Katie Campbell Levasseur, David K. Ware, June Gold, and Jack Dougherty](authors.html)*

Our **[Restricting with Property Covenants](restricting.html) chapter in this book** was inspired by several public history and advocacy projects across the U.S, including several now organized as the [National Covenants Research Coalition](https://www.nationalcovenantsresearchcoalition.com). One of the earliest to launch online was the [Segregated Seattle project](https://depts.washington.edu/civilr/segregated.htm) in 2005, where researchers found White-only and anti-Jewish covenants in tens of thousands of properties across King County and Washington State. Their public history work pushed state legislators to approve a 2006 law to encourage homeowners to strike out racist covenants in the public record, and a 2023 law to provide compensation for victims.^[@NationalCovenantsResearch2022. The earliest digital history project on racial property deeds probably was @plotkinRacialReligiousRestrictive2015, which states that content was posted online prior to 1999. On Seattle and Washington State, see @gregorySegregatedSeattle2006 and @civilrightsandlaborhistoryconsortiumuniversityofwashingtonRacialRestrictiveCovenants2023.]

This chapter outlines three strategies for finding race restrictive covenants in Connecticut. Our methods vary by the type of land records available in each town clerk's office, and they also changed over time as many town clerks hired vendors to digitize some or all of their records. Where possible, consult experts who have more experience, such as property lawyers, professional title searchers, and people involved with the [National Covenants Research Coalition](https://www.nationalcovenantsresearchcoalition.com). We share our experiences to encourage readers to search their own local property records, build public awareness of how racism shaped our communities, and to advocate for policies that promote justice in housing.

### From Oral Interviews to Printed Records {-}
In summer 2010, when Katie Campbell and Jack Dougherty began searching for restrictive covenants in West Hartford, we began with anecdotal oral histories that we attempted to confirm in the printed property records. But we faced several obstacles. First, the Town of West Hartford's property records room contained over 4,000 print volumes, with some paper indexes but few digitized records at that time. Second, we had no legal training nor experience with title searching. Third, no one in our small circle of Hartford-area civil rights activists, attorneys, or town officials had ever seen a restrictive covenant, so we didn't know exactly what to look for or whether we would actually find one. We limited our search to property records in West Hartford, the largest municipality bordering the City of Hartford, and did not attempt to find restrictive covenants elsewhere.

Tracey Wilson, the West Hartford town historian and history teacher, gave us leads for possible covenants from anecdotal accounts by long-term residents while writing her monthly history column in the *West Hartford Life* periodical. Our most specific lead came from Mary Everett, who described in our history interview how she bought a home at 30 Ledgewood Road around 1970, when her lawyer mentioned that the property included a racially restrictive covenant from the 1940s that was no longer enforceable.^[@everettOralHistoryInterview2011]

Working backwards with property records, we traced the real estate transaction from the 1970s to the original deed in the 1940s. When conducting our research in 2010, the Town of West Hartford had recently made available a public online property assessment database, which allowed searches by name or address, but with transactions only into the 1970s. Our search for Mary Everett (or her spouse, Ronald) pointed us to a 1970 warranty deed in book 474, page 185, available only in print volumes in the property records room. This 1970 deed referred to the printed book and page numbers for prior transactions. By tracing the trail backwards in time, we finally found the original 1940 deed for the High Ledge Homes subdivision, which included this race restriction: "No persons of any race except the white race shall use or occupy any building on any lot except that this covenant shall not prevent occupancy by domestic servants of a different race employed by an owner or tenant." Also, the entire High Ledge Homes subdivision appeared on a wall map in the property room, which referenced a 1938 subdivision surveyor's map number 222, stored separately on microfilm in the town clerk's office. By matching up past and present maps, we geographically confirmed that 30 Ledgewood Road was constructed on building lot #78, one of the 84 parcels of land specifically restricted by the racial covenant in the original 1940 subdivision deed, described in the video in Figure \@ref(fig:2011-covenants-video).^[@campbellHowWeFound2011; @highledgehomesinc.AgreementConcerningBuilding1940]

(ref:2011-covenants-video) In this [2011 video](https://player.vimeo.com/video/220562166), Katie Campbell Levasseur describes how we traced restrictive covenants in paper property records in the Town of West Hartford town clerk's office.

Looking back, over the past decade the partial digitization of West Hartford records makes the job somewhat easier today, but still requires searching print volumes to reliably trace sales back into the 1940s. First, the [Town of West Hartford Online Assessment Database](https://gis.vgsi.com/westhartfordct/Default.aspx) offers name and address search, but ownership history is currently incomplete prior to the 1970s. Second, the [Town of West Hartford Land Records portal](https://www.westhartfordct.gov/town-departments/townl-clerk/land-records) offers search by name, date, and book-page number (not consistently by address or parcel number), but many document images are still not available online, and lands records are incomplete prior to 1963. Searching by paper is still necessary for land records in this town at this point in time.

A second search strategy we tried with paper-only records in 2010 was to widen our scope of sales agreements in the racial covenant time period (roughly 1920s through 1940s). In the Town of West Hartford property records room, we skimmed an index list of transactions for relevant years, in a print volume called the Grantor Index Corporate Pages, and searched for "agreements." Then we inspected each agreement in the print volume to see if the deed included a restriction between parties. Using this approach, we identified about 200 deeds listed as agreements, and among those we found 22 agreements that included some type of restrictions, all between 1933 and 1949. (We determined that before 1933, searching for "agreements" was not a productive way to look for restrictions, because we found restrictions in deeds that were not listed as having "agreements".) As a result, we found two types of restrictions on property deeds between 1915 and 1950, which we labeled *value* and *race*. Value restrictions were more common than race restrictions. Value restrictions typically stated that the owner could not build a home below a certain square footage, or below a minimum price (such as $5,000 in the 1920s), in an effort to maintain higher property values. But race restrictions stated that the land could not be occupied by non-White people, except for domestic servants. In some cases, deeds combined the two types. In either case, individuals or developers used these restrictions to control the social class and/or racial composition of a neighborhood, and its relative price in the minds of prospective wealthy White buyers.

Our third strategy in 2010 was to search the full-text *Hartford Courant* historical newspaper database, a relatively new technology at that time, for "restrictive covenant" and related terms. We found a handful of news stories but none of them directly mentioned West Hartford. For example, we found 1947 news accounts about Simon Bernstein, a Hartford lawyer and Democratic city council member, publicly asked the state legislative Judiciary Committee to invalidate race- and religious-restrictive covenants. We were fortunate to conduct an oral history interview with Bernstein at age 98, and he told us about one race restrictive covenant case he was involved in, regarding the Mountain Road area of West Hartford, which was settled out of court. But we never found any documentation about it.[@BernsteinSeeksEnd1947; @bernsteinOralHistoryInterview2011.]

In sum, while our 2010 study of West Hartford was not exhaustive, we located race restrictive covenants in 5 subdivisions that included about 190 parcels of land in the early 1940s. We estimate about 6 percent of West Hartford homes built during this period had restrictive covenants, given around 3,020 buildings were constructed in town during the 1940s. We count the entire decade because developers did not successfully sell homes on every parcel during the Depression and World War. In 2012 we placed scanned PDFs of all historical documents and digitized subdivision boundaries in an interactive Google Map, hosted by the University of Connecticut Libraries Map and Geographic Information Center. In 2017, we migrated historical documents and geodata into our [GitHub public repository](https://github.com/ontheline/otl-covenants/) and displayed them in our [open-source Leaflet map](https://ontheline.github.io/otl-covenants/index-caption.html).^[See table calculations, historical documents, and map code in @ilyankouMapRaceRestrictive2017]

Starting with anecdotal accounts of restrictive covenants produced mixed results, which perhaps tells us something about *historical memory* and how people believe they remember the past. While conducting our research in 2010, and still to this day, we have heard several West Hartford residents describe their memories of anti-Jewish or anti-Catholic restrictive covenants on their homes, yet we have not found any such documents on their specific property records, nor any religious-based covenants in West Hartford as of this writing. For example, in two 2021 publications about the history of segregation in West Hartford, Mayor Shari Cantor recalled that her home on Colony Road "actually had a restrictive covenant and did not allow Jewish people." But when tracing back the paper records, we found no documentation of any restrictive covenant on her property. One explanation might be that homeowners confuse different tools of housing discrimination. Rather than a restrictive covenant (which would appear in a property deed), perhaps the prohibition appeared in a homeowner association agreement (which might exist on paper, but not filed with the town government) or real estate agents' refusals to show property to outsiders (which may have been openly discussed, but not documented on paper).

ADD IN HERE 

"Shari Cantor, West Hartford’s mayor, says she understands her town’s history of discriminatory housing practices, noting that the house she lives in once held a restrictive covenant. Today, she says, she hopes to create a more inclusive town — but is wary of any housing policy that might risk residents’ property values."

** See also how Tracey Wilson wrote about Shari Cantor's experience in this article, but does not refer to a restrictive covenant. Instead, Tracy writes:
By contrast, Shari Cantor, West Hartford’s current mayor and a resident on Colony Road since 2009, and others from the neighborhood say that Jews were excluded from buying on that street for many decades after the ample Tudor homes were built in 1929 and 1930. A look at the names from the city directory in 1958 supports this assertion.

But few of our anecdotal leads yielded successful results. Local historian Tracey Wilson heard several anecdotal accounts from West Hartford residents regarding anti-Jewish and anti-Catholic covenants during this period. In her 2010 essay, Wilson wrote: "By word of mouth I had heard that in the 1930s and 1940s and into the 1950s, no Roman Catholics could live on Stoner Drive, the first street developed on 'the mountain.' No Catholics could buy on Wood Pond or Sunset Farms. According to another resident, the address of a house on the corner of Foxcroft Road and Fern Street was changed to Fern Street because no Jews were allowed on Foxcroft Rd."[@wilsonTakingStockHigh2010] But we have not yet found a religion-based restriction in a property deed in West Hartford. It is possible that some residents may have confused property deed covenants (which would appear in town hall documents) with homeowner association agreements (which may exist on paper, but not filed with town governments) or real estate agents' refusals to show property to outsiders (which may have been openly discussed, but not documented on paper). To be clear, our study of West Hartford was not comprehensive, and we suspect that more race and religious restrictions exist on paper in this and other cities and towns across the state.











### Focus on Subdivision Maps {-}
In year (?), David Ware shared his research Jack on racially restrictive covenants he uncovered in his hometown of Manchester, Connecticut...


TODO: Integrate Dave Ware's research strategy and ask for his permission to include:
Anyway, having mentioned my “sampling” activity and my research approach, let me share that approach with you.  The approach is based on the fact that, especially in our “bedroom” towns, many larger tracts of land were subdivided and developed for residential purposes in the first half of the 20th century.  So, I go to the Town Clerk’s office of a given town, and here’s what I do:

- Look at subdivision maps on record at the town hall.  To start with, focus on subdivisions approved in the 1930’s and 40s.  That is the time frame when we probably have the greatest chance of identifying these covenants.  Expand to looking at subdivisions of the 20’s if there isn’t much happening in the 30’s and 40s.  In some towns, you may be able to access these maps on the Town Clerk’s computer, and in other towns, you will be looking at old, original paper maps stored in big, wide, flat drawers.  It’s a history lover’s dream!
- The maps will identify the owner of the property being subdivided, and/or the “developer” of the property.  Make a note of the names of those people or companies. And make a note of the DATE of the map.  Also, jot down the name of the subdivision – you know:  “Elm Ridge”, or “Clearview Heights”, or “Winter Hill”, or whatever.  All of that info will come in handy.
- For a “quick” sampling, I jot down the owner/developer names for the larger subdivisions – you know , those that are creating new neighborhoods of 30, 40, 50, 60 or more residential lots.  Those kind of developments are definitely ones where the developers want to create a “standard” form of deed for the sale of the lots to builders or homeowners, in order to keep things uniform among all of the buyers of the lots.  This is not to say that smaller subdivisions never contain the race-based covenants, but, again, for efficiency, I start with the bigger subdivisions.
- The developer or owner of the approved subdivision that you have just found (and made notes about) will become the first seller, or “Grantor” of all of the lots in that subdivision.  So, now consult the “Grantor Index” for the time period following the approval of the subdivision.  Example, if the subdivision was approved in 1940, I look at the grantor index for 1940 to 1950, and I look for the name of the developer or owner.
- Often, we see that the developer or “Grantor” for the newly approved development starts selling his lots relatively soon after approval of the subdivision, so we often see multiple entries by the developer/Grantor in the year or two following subdivision approval.  The entries in the Grantor Indexes usually contain a brief description of the property being conveyed.  So, e.g., if Burton Larson owned the property that was approved in 1940 as the “Winter Hill” development, and if Larson sold three lots of his newly approved development to Manny’s Home Builders, Inc., in 1941, then in the Grantor Index covering 1941, the entry under “Larson” will say something like “Winterhill Lots 6,7 & 8”.  Go and look at the Volume and Page number for that transaction to see the deed by which Larson sold those lots.  If Larson was one of the developers who decided to use the race-based covenants, you’ll see it in that deed.  And, I’ll bet you lunch, you’ll see it in every other deed for every other lot that Larson sells in Winter Hill.
- If I don’t see the offensive covenant in the first deed I choose to review for a given development, I will go and look at one or two other deeds in that development, using the same approach as just described, just to feel a little more confident that I’m not missing something.  
- Sticking with the “Winter Hill” example, if I don’t see the covenants in “Winter Hill” deeds, I scratch that development off my list, and I move on to the next development for which I made notes from the subdivision maps. And, I just go down the list in the same manner as described above.
- There are some additional tips and hints that I use, but the above steps essentially describe what I do.



### Search Digitized Property Records {-}
In 2023, June Gold began to search for racially restrictive covenants in her hometown(?) of Hamden Connecticut, and as a retired attorney, offered her pro bono services to residents to void them using the 2021 state law.

Earlier in Hamden see @tuhusVestigesRacismLive1994

Searching covenants in Hamden became easier than most other Connecticut towns because the Town Clerk contracted with a service to digitize all land records from (date)
As of early 2024, the [Avenu Insights & Analytics platform](https://www.uslandrecords.com/ctlr/) online holdings are publicly viewable, beginning from certain years in selected Connecticut towns, as shown in table X.[@avenuinsightsandanalyticsConnecticutLandRecords2024] Note that the earliest year generally refers to a digitized Land Index or images of specific Recorded Land documents, and that associated maps may be available for different time periods. See also Avenu's [US Land Records platform] for selected other states. Check the Avenue site platform or individual Town Clerk land record offices for details.

June's process:
- began with family member who discovered racially restrictive covenant in their property deed
- The Town of Hamden worked with a vendor to digitize their property records since (YEAR?) and make them publicly viewable online, primarily for use by title searchers working for real estate lawyers. (Official name and LINK) Online property records for the Town of Hamden are quite robust, allowing her to conduct a search from her computer screen, rather than going in-person to the property records room at Town Clerk's office.
- But online searches of town property records are constrained in several ways. First, there is not yet "full-text" search capability, meaning she *cannot* easily search across scanned documents of property deeds for key words and phrases, such as "white race." Second, online property records are primarily organized to search by names of owners, transaction date, and volume number, but not by street address. So title searching requires hunting backwards in time from the current owner to prior owners.
- When she has a name for property with a known covenant, she can trace back the transfer of ownership through the volume and page numbers, sometimes over several transactions, to the 1930s-40s covenant, as shown in the screencast
- After locating one property with a racially restrictive covenant, she can search the ownership paper trail of neighboring homes, especially those located in the same subdivision created by the developer, and filed on 1930s-40s map that has also been digitized in the Town Clerk's property records.
- Likewise, after identifying one real estate developer who added a racially restrictive covenant to a land record, you can search for other properties owned by the same developer. Give example...
- To identify present-day owners of neighboring properties that may have racially restrictive covenants, she searches the Hamden tax assessor property database, which allows searching by street to find the owners of each property. For example, if Carmalt Road is a likely area, she can look up the street listing for current owners of each house, and use their names to search the trail of ownership in the property records database.
- Also, after finding a racially restrictive covenant in one property record volume, she also searches for similar documents (such as "agreement" or "warranty deed") in the same or adjacent volumes. Also, can use the Town's tax assessment map to identify the geographic outlines of 1930s-40s subdivisions to hunt for possible covenants.
