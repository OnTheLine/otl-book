## How We Found Restrictive Covenants {- #covenants}
*by [Katie Campbell Levasseur, David K. Ware, June Gold, and Jack Dougherty](authors.html)*

TODO rewrite intro to organize sections to come: This chapter outlines the process of historical research and public awareness of race restrictive covenants, across the nation but more in-depth in Connecticut, to help future scholars and advocates...

TODO: Integrate Dave Ware's research strategy and ask for his permission to include:
Anyway, having mentioned my “sampling” activity and my research approach, let me share that approach with you.  The approach is based on the fact that, especially in our “bedroom” towns, many larger tracts of land were subdivided and developed for residential purposes in the first half of the 20th century.  So, I go to the Town Clerk’s office of a given town, and here’s what I do:

- Look at subdivision maps on record at the town hall.  To start with, focus on subdivisions approved in the 1930’s and 40s.  That is the time frame when we probably have the greatest chance of identifying these covenants.  Expand to looking at subdivisions of the 20’s if there isn’t much happening in the 30’s and 40s.  In some towns, you may be able to access these maps on the Town Clerk’s computer, and in other towns, you will be looking at old, original paper maps stored in big, wide, flat drawers.  It’s a history lover’s dream!
- The maps will identify the owner of the property being subdivided, and/or the “developer” of the property.  Make a note of the names of those people or companies. And make a note of the DATE of the map.  Also, jot down the name of the subdivision – you know:  “Elm Ridge”, or “Clearview Heights”, or “Winter Hill”, or whatever.  All of that info will come in handy.
- For a “quick” sampling, I jot down the owner/developer names for the larger subdivisions – you know , those that are creating new neighborhoods of 30, 40, 50, 60 or more residential lots.  Those kind of developments are definitely ones where the developers want to create a “standard” form of deed for the sale of the lots to builders or homeowners, in order to keep things uniform among all of the buyers of the lots.  This is not to say that smaller subdivisions never contain the race-based covenants, but, again, for efficiency, I start with the bigger subdivisions.
- The developer or owner of the approved subdivision that you have just found (and made notes about) will become the first seller, or “Grantor” of all of the lots in that subdivision.  So, now consult the “Grantor Index” for the time period following the approval of the subdivision.  Example, if the subdivision was approved in 1940, I look at the grantor index for 1940 to 1950, and I look for the name of the developer or owner.
- Often, we see that the developer or “Grantor” for the newly approved development starts selling his lots relatively soon after approval of the subdivision, so we often see multiple entries by the developer/Grantor in the year or two following subdivision approval.  The entries in the Grantor Indexes usually contain a brief description of the property being conveyed.  So, e.g., if Burton Larson owned the property that was approved in 1940 as the “Winter Hill” development, and if Larson sold three lots of his newly approved development to Manny’s Home Builders, Inc., in 1941, then in the Grantor Index covering 1941, the entry under “Larson” will say something like “Winterhill Lots 6,7 & 8”.  Go and look at the Volume and Page number for that transaction to see the deed by which Larson sold those lots.  If Larson was one of the developers who decided to use the race-based covenants, you’ll see it in that deed.  And, I’ll bet you lunch, you’ll see it in every other deed for every other lot that Larson sells in Winter Hill.
- If I don’t see the offensive covenant in the first deed I choose to review for a given development, I will go and look at one or two other deeds in that development, using the same approach as just described, just to feel a little more confident that I’m not missing something.  
- Sticking with the “Winter Hill” example, if I don’t see the covenants in “Winter Hill” deeds, I scratch that development off my list, and I move on to the next development for which I made notes from the subdivision maps. And, I just go down the list in the same manner as described above.
- There are some additional tips and hints that I use, but the above steps essentially describe what I do.




The [Restricting with Property Covenants](restricting.html) section in this book was inspired by the [Seattle Civil Rights & Labor History Project](http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/segregated.htm). Students and faculty at the University of Washington-Seattle uncovered the largely forgotten story of White-only restrictions that landowners wrote into more than 400 property deeds from the 1910s to the 1960s, which shaped the racially segregated metropolitan region that exists today. Their public history project launched a campaign that led the governor to sign a 2006 bill that made it easier for neighborhoods to officially remove these covenants, which became unenforceable in 1948, but persisted on legal documents.^[@gregorySegregatedSeattle2010. See additional digital collections of restrictive covenants in other cities: @universityofminnesotalibrariesMappingPrejudice2020; @prologuedcMappingSegregationDC2020]

Our goal was to search for restrictive covenants of any type, racial or religious, in the metropolitan Hartford area, as described in the video in Figure \@ref(fig:2011-covenants-video).^[@campbellHowWeFound2011] But no one we consulted had ever seen such a document, nor did we have any experience searching property deeds. So we read about the history of these barriers in other cities and learned as much as we could about the research process. People with more experience (such as property lawyers, professional deed searchers, and scholars who specialize in this topic) may have more helpful advice to offer.

(ref:2011-covenants-video) In this [video](https://player.vimeo.com/video/220562166), Katie Campbell Levasseur describes how we found restrictive covenants in the Town of West Hartford property records in 2011.

We limited our search of restrictive covenants to property records held by the Town of West Hartford, Connecticut, the largest municipality that borders the central city of Hartford, because of easy access to public data and our focus on suburban history. Our study did not examine any property records in the City of Hartford or any other suburban town, and we encourage other researchers to expand our collective search. Tracey Wilson, the West Hartford town historian, long-time high school history teacher, and history columnist for the West Hartford Life monthly periodical, gave us leads from anecdotal accounts she had heard about restrictive covenants from long-time residents. Our most specific lead came from Mary Everett, who in our recorded oral history interview described how she bought a home at 30 Ledgewood Road around 1970, and her lawyer mentioned that the property included a racially restrictive covenant from the 1940s that was no longer enforceable.^[@everettOralHistoryInterview2011]

Our first search strategy was to begin with oral history leads about specific properties, then work backwards to trace the sale to the original deed. When we conducted our research in 2011, the Town of West Hartford had recently made recent property records available online.^[As of 2017, Town of West Hartford property records can be searched for recent transactions (1970s and later) at <https://www.westhartfordct.gov/gov/onlinesvc.asp>] Searching by name for Mary Everett (or her spouse, Ronald) pointed us to a 1970 warranty deed listing in book 474, page 185, which we had to find in the paper records at Town Hall. Also, her residence at 30 Ledgewood Road appeared as building lot #78 in the microfilmed parcel map records of the original land development from the 1940s. In the paper books, we traced the 1970 sale further back into time, and eventually discovered the original 1940 deed for the High Ledge Homes subdivision, which included this race restriction: "No persons of any race except the white race shall use or occupy any building on any lot except that this covenant shall not prevent occupancy by domestic servants of a different race employed by an owner or tenant."[@highledgehomesinc.AgreementConcerningBuilding1940]

But few of our anecdotal leads yielded successful results. So our second search strategy was to conduct a broader search of property records during the racial covenant time period (1920s through the late 1940s). In the Town of West Hartford property records room, we skimmed the Grantor Index Corporate Pages for “agreements,” and then inspected each agreement in its physical book to see if the deed included a restriction between parties. Using this approach, we identified about 200 deeds that listed agreements, and among those we found 22 agreements that included some type of restrictions, all between 1933 and 1949. (We determined that before 1933, searching for "agreements" was not a productive way to look for restrictions, because we found restrictions in deeds that were not listed as having "agreements".)

Overall, we found two types of restrictions on property deeds between 1915 and 1950, which we labeled "value" and "race." Value restrictions were more common than race restrictions. Value restrictions typically stated that the owner could not build a home below a certain square footage, or below a minimum price (such as $5,000 in the 1920s), in an effort to maintain higher property values. But race restrictions stated that the land could not be occupied by non-White people, except for domestic servants. In some cases, deeds combined the two types. In either case, individuals or developers used these restrictions to control the social class and/or racial composition of a neighborhood, and its relative price in the minds of prospective wealthy White buyers.

Our study of West Hartford in 2011 was not exhaustive. We found only 5 race restrictive covenants, which covered less than 200 parcels of land, or around 3 percent of the 6,000 single-family homes that had been constructed in the town according to the 1940 Census. The first race restrictive covenant we found was introduced to High Ledge Homes in March 1940 by Edward Hammel, a developer of "fine homes" in Westchester County, NY and Fairfield County, CT. After he established the Whites-only restriction in his subdivision of about 75 homes, we found 4 similar development-wide covenants in other parts of West Hartford for 1940 and 1941. In 2012, we placed all of these historical documents and parcel maps in an interactive Google Map, hosted by the University of Connecticut Libraries Map and Geographic Information Center. Then in 2016-17 we migrated the historical source data into our [GitHub public repository](https://github.com/ontheline/otl-covenants/) and an interactive Leaflet map.^[@ilyankouMapRaceRestrictive2017. For housing data, see SE:T75, Housing Units by Type of Unit, for West Hartford tracts (C1-6), 1940 Census Tracts, Social Explorer, <https://www.socialexplorer.com/tables/C1940TractDS/R11422383>.]

When searching for "racial covenant" and related terms in the full-text Hartford Courant Historical database, we found only a handful of news stories relevant to Connecticut, but none of them specific to West Hartford. For example, the Courant describes how Hartford lawyer and Democratic alderman Simon Bernstein sought to pressure the Judiciary Committee of the Connecticut General Assembly to invalidate race- and religious-restrictive covenants in 1947. We were fortunate to conduct an oral history interview with Bernstein at age 98, and he told us about one race restrictive covenant case he was involved in, regarding the Mountain Road area of West Hartford, which was settled out of court. But we never found any documentation about it.[@BernsteinSeeksEnd1947; @bernsteinOralHistoryInterview2011.]

Local historian Tracey Wilson heard several anecdotal accounts from West Hartford residents regarding anti-Jewish and anti-Catholic covenants during this period. In her 2010 essay, Wilson wrote: "By word of mouth I had heard that in the 1930s and 1940s and into the 1950s, no Roman Catholics could live on Stoner Drive, the first street developed on 'the mountain.' No Catholics could buy on Wood Pond or Sunset Farms. According to another resident, the address of a house on the corner of Foxcroft Road and Fern Street was changed to Fern Street because no Jews were allowed on Foxcroft Rd."[@wilsonTakingStockHigh2010] But we have not yet found a religion-based restriction in a property deed in West Hartford. It is possible that some residents may have confused property deed covenants (which would appear in town hall documents) with homeowner association agreements (which may exist on paper, but not filed with town governments) or real estate agents' refusals to show property to outsiders (which may have been openly discussed, but not documented on paper). To be clear, our study of West Hartford was not comprehensive, and we suspect that more race and religious restrictions exist on paper in this and other cities and towns across the state.

### Finding Covenants and Changing the Law to Remove Them
In year (?), David Ware shared his research Jack on racially restrictive covenants he uncovered in his hometown of Manchester, Connecticut...

### Searching Digitized Property Records in Hamden
In 2023, June Gold began to search for racially restrictive covenants in her hometown(?) of Hamden Connecticut, and as a retired attorney, offered her pro bono services to residents to void them using the 2021 state law.

Earlier in Hamden see @tuhusVestigesRacismLive1994

Searching covenants in Hamden became easier than most other Connecticut towns because the Town Clerk contracted with a service to digitize all land records from (date)
As of early 2024, the [Avenu Insights & Analytics platform](https://www.uslandrecords.com/ctlr/) online holdings are publicly viewable, beginning from certain years in selected Connecticut towns, as shown in table X.[@avenuinsightsandanalyticsConnecticutLandRecords2024] Note that the earliest year generally refers to a digitized Land Index or images of specific Recorded Land documents, and that associated maps may be available for different time periods. See also Avenu's [US Land Records platform] for selected other states. Check the Avenue site platform or individual Town Clerk land record offices for details.

June's process:
- began with family member who discovered racially restrictive covenant in their property deed
- The Town of Hamden worked with a vendor to digitize their property records since (YEAR?) and make them publicly viewable online, primarily for use by title searchers working for real estate lawyers. (Official name and LINK) Online property records for the Town of Hamden are quite robust, allowing her to conduct a search from her computer screen, rather than going in-person to the property records room at Town Clerk's office.
- But online searches of town property records are constrained in several ways. First, there is not yet "full-text" search capability, meaning she *cannot* easily search across scanned documents of property deeds for key words and phrases, such as "white race." Second, online property records are primarily organized to search by names of owners, transaction date, and volume number, but not by street address. So title searching requires hunting backwards in time from the current owner to prior owners.
- When she has a name for property with a known covenant, she can trace back the transfer of ownership through the volume and page numbers, sometimes over several transactions, to the 1930s-40s covenant, as shown in the screencast
- After locating one property with a racially restrictive covenant, she can search the ownership paper trail of neighboring homes, especially those located in the same subdivision created by the developer, and filed on 1930s-40s map that has also been digitized in the Town Clerk's property records.
- Likewise, after identifying one real estate developer who added a racially restrictive covenant to a land record, you can search for other properties owned by the same developer. Give example...
- To identify present-day owners of neighboring properties that may have racially restrictive covenants, she searches the Hamden tax assessor property database, which allows searching by street to find the owners of each property. For example, if Carmalt Road is a likely area, she can look up the street listing for current owners of each house, and use their names to search the trail of ownership in the property records database.
- Also, after finding a racially restrictive covenant in one property record volume, she also searches for similar documents (such as "agreement" or "warranty deed") in the same or adjacent volumes. Also, can use the Town's tax assessment map to identify the geographic outlines of 1930s-40s subdivisions to hunt for possible covenants.
