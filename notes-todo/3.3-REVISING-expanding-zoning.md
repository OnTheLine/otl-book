## REVISING -- Expanding Zoning Across Suburbs {- #expanding-zoning}

After Connecticut legislators allowed local governments to enact zoning in 1923, these policies quickly spread across the state. By 1957, X percent of Connecticut towns had zoning and/or planning commissions.... rural communities in the northwest and eastern portions of the state less likely to adopt zoning due to low population growth. But in the rapidly-expanding metropolitan Hartford region, nearly 100% of towns enacted zoning and/or planning



How did zoning happen across these towns, and how did exclusivity vary? To answer these questions, this chapter examines how zoning grew across very different but adjacent suburban towns: Avon, Bloomfield, and West Hartford.
Although West Hartford was the first local government to enact zoning, Bloomfield hired its own expert to catch up in the 1920s and zoned its land with more exclusive minimums by 1950s. Furthermore, while Avon residents initially opposed zoning in the 1930s, they hired zoning experts in the 1950s and voted in rules that were even more exclusive than any of its neighboring suburban towns.

### Calculating zoning, taxes, and schools {-}
By mid-twentieth century, Connecticut suburbs fiercely competed against one another by using zoning policies to attract property buyers to pay taxes to support local governmental services, such as public schools.
Although metropolitan Hartford functioned as a regional economy, colonial-era Connecticut [carved out towns as separate local governments](carving.html), rather than pooling resources together as a county government.
In this era, local governmental services were funded almost entirely by local property taxes, with limited contributions from state or federal funds. Each town's primary goal was to increase its taxable property, also known as the grand list, meaning the assessor's official estimate of the value of all homes, businesses, factories, and farms within its boundaries. If a town could increase its total taxable property, without sharply increasing the percentage spent on government services, property tax rates would remain stable for homeowners who voted in local elections.

Complicating this calculation was the rising cost of local school expenses. During the early 1900s, costs were relatively low... but rose sharply during 1950s/60s -- CPEC data

Given the dual pressures of property tax revenues and public school expenditures, towns made tough decisions about how to zone undeveloped land...

- if towns made zoning very exclusive, only wealthy buyers would be able to afford larger property lots, which would only slightly increase the overall population and demand for local governmental services. However, if zoning became too exclusive and exceeded the market demand for homes in that price range, unsold land would remain vacant and not generate sufficient property tax revenue. Unlike the saying "build it and they will come," town governments could not assume a stance of "zone it and developers will build."

- On the other hand, if towns made zoning less exclusive, more middle-class buyers would be able to afford smaller property lots, and overall tax revenues would rise. But increasing numbers of residents (especially those with school-age children) would create increasing demand on local government services (especially schools). If you believe in the saying "build it and they will come," it's possible that the population may grow faster than you can accommodate in public schools....

Although Connecticut town leaders hired planners to guide their decision-making, no one could guarantee what the future would hold. During periods of rapid growth in the 1920s or 1950s, experts often made population projections that in hindsight appear preposterous.
Zoning policies also required town leaders to decide how much land to set aside for industrial and commercial space, or mixed residential-commercial space, and to find ways to entice developers to build in their own, rather than a competing town next door.

Exclusionary zoning expanded in this setting because it fit perfectly into the logic of Connecticut's local government and property tax system. Suburban towns fiercely competed with one another to attract upper-class families, who would buy more expensive homes to increase their property tax base, while raising relatively smaller families and bringing smaller numbers of children into the public schools, compared to working-class family sizes (TODO check)
...During the 1920s, when mass transportation and home construction enabled Hartford residents to move to nearby suburbs and commute back to their workplaces, this movement fueled town-versus-town competition to attract higher-income residents, who could afford to purchase higher-priced homes, and pay higher property tax bills per family to local government. Towns quickly adopted zoning laws with minimum-land rules per family. More restrictive zoning rules raised the average home price by requiring a larger land purchase, and the lower population density reduced the number of families and children who needed government services such as schools. Exclusionary zoning fit perfectly into the logic of Connecticut's town government and property tax system
...Connecticut town leaders were highly motivated by a fiscal equation that favored exclusion of lower-income families.





## Zoning Bloomfield: The Booming Commuter Town





trolley line to Center built by Italian laborers and finally opened 1909, with major celebration p90 opening of original 13-stanza poem by Chandler Miller, titled: ON to bloomfield, the Suburbs in the Hills On to bloomfield has, for many a year, Been the cry, till now the trolley is here On to Bloomfield, with its vales and its rills On to Bloomfield, the suburb in the hills "The banquet in the town hall was followed by speeches which revealed some ambivalence, looking at both good and bad features of the 'invasion of the first electric car.' Optimists believed thet people would leave the 'unhealthful tenements' for the good air of the country, only a ten cent fare away from the city. Real estate would boom and there would be a growth in population as new one-family hosues were built. Fear was also expressed, that local businesses would lose out as residents used the trolley to go to Hartford to shop." p92 Trolley line increased Italian immigration into Bloomfield's East Side in 1920

 "Increasingly, Bloomfield became a commuter town, as larger numbers of people looked to Hartford for employment, many of them in the insurance companies." p103
"In the late 1920s, efforts wer made to entice urban residents to Bloomfield. The town was given wide publicity as an attractive suburb of Hartford. In 1928..the town boasted of its residential character - no manufacturing. Emphasis was on fine estates and homes, 'plush' growth, and belief that 'land values will rise by leaps and bounds'.... The Blue Hills area, adjacent to Hartford, was described as 'removed from the center' a section of houses of the 'bungalow' type. Water lines were being laid, a high school site had been purchased, and the town had hired a professional to draw up a zoning plan. The zoning regulations, adopted in 1929, are an example of far-sighted vision and planning. " p107
 "Despite the Depression, the 1937 Town Report noted that more new residences were under construction than at any previous time in the town's history." p107 the post-WWII pop boom "might have left Bloomfield only a 'bedroom' town. Visionary thinking and intense efforts to locate industry here overcame that eventuality. Growth in numbers of schoolage children by 1944 required a new school, a story repeated several times over the next decades."  p110 @wintonburyhistoricalsocietyWintonburyBloomfield1983

Bloomfield became one of Connecticut's first towns to create a Planning Commission in 1917, which supervised the layout or new roads and housing subdivisions p193
Bloomfield created a Zoning Commission in 1926 WHS p193

Bloomfield voted to form Zoning Commission in Aug 1926
Zoning has been topic for past two years; several years ago Blue Hills land developed by real estate promoters "As a consequence, all kinds and classes of houses were built"
@WillVoteZoning1926; @ZoneCommissionFive1926
April 1927 The town of Bloomfield has created a zoning commission in order to get a comprehensive town plan and zoning ordinance. In accordance with a vote of the town, it has engaged Herbert S. Swan of New York as expert.
@ZoningProblemsBe1927

Nov 1927
The zoning committee of the town held a meeting at the town building Wednesday evening at which Herbert Swan, zoning expert, outlined the zoning regulations which are being drafted and also submitted a layout of Roberts Park. Mr. Swan is to prepare a survey in detail of his proposed layout of Roberts Park.

1928 Bloomfield Town Plan by Herbert Swan
Bloomfield will always be "a residence suburb" because "people who come to live in town must find their livelihood in Hartford" and the town must accept this fact, p.1
Hartford residential areas are almost completely built up, wth few vacant lots, so needs to capitalize on its location to widening urban community; with intellgient growth "its character will become progressively more distinctive and distinguishable from neighboring suburbs" p2
"The growth of Bloomfield will always depend to an exceptional degree upon its relationship to Hartford. The more intimately it can develop its plan with that of Hartford, the more growth Bloomfield will enjoy, as the growing suburan population of Hartford will undoubtedly seek out residence localities which, other things being equal, will be as near in the matter of time distance as possible to the business district of Hartford" p5
prepare major thoroughfare from Hartford to Bloomfield: lists 13 connector streets, some to be widened, p6
Land subdivisions: so far, very small proportion of land has been subdivided, but "very little good" can be said of current subdivisions, with max lots for developers but no major/minor streets and connecting roads, p. 18
"The zoning regulations in Bloomfield demand...." [unclear if they already exist, or should exist; probably the latter]
A zone = min land 5000 sq ft per family, 50 foot width (but town should demand 6250 sq ft), p19-20
(later B zone is mentioned, but no min land req given here)

Bloomfield did not shy away from affordable two-family housing in 1942
Within the next week the Bloomfield Town Plan and Zoning Commission will hold a public hearing on the application of the Harry L. Osias Realty Company of Brooklyn, N. Y., to develop a tract of land off Blue Hills Avenue and construct about 120 duplex-type houses... each unit would house two families, each of whom would hold title to the side in which it lived"
each duplex lot would be about 11k sq ft, meaning 5.5k per family; if granted, will become "D" residential zone; already has city sewers and water

other nearby towns still growing; "Minimum lot requirements in residential zones are much higher in Bloomfield than in any of the three towns in Table 5"; R80, R40, R30 in western area, so ultimate pop fig "can be kept much lower thna in any of the towns in the Table if the area requirements for housing lots in the zoning regulations are not substantially lowered." p9
Concern about high room occupancy in Blue Hills area according to census data; housing code enforcement needed p11
"Bloomfield has almost no multiple housing. There are some two-family houses in the R10 zone but nothing that could be classified as an apartment or a tenement house. Garden apartments are being discussed" see 1959 memo attached; also amendment to allow apartments as special exceptiosn in R10 and R15 zones p11
School sites: acc to pop projections, rec 2 new school sites of at least 50 acres each in tract 7D before 1970
Zoning ordinance adopted 1929, revised 1950 with new map and definitions. A (15k) B (10k) and C (7.5k) replaced with R30, R20, R15, R10. During 1950s, added R80 and R40 p21
@shurtleffBloomfieldConnecticutMaster1961

1959-61 proposal to allow low-density garden apartments
Apdx C Garden Apt memo (prepared in 1959 and attached to this 1961 report for convenience): developers advocate for low-volume garden apartments. A 1954 Windsor study found no vacancies in 918 garden apartments in Hartford, East Hartford, Manchester, West Hartford, Wethersfield. Other towns are considering allowing them in zoning. "Education costs, the biggest single item in local budgets are much less, since the average is less than one child per family [in garden apartments] as against two or even three for families occupying single family units." Windsor 1954 report found avg 0.37 children per family in garden apartments (ranging from 0.2 to 0.6) p47-48
more recent comparison of Loomis Drive WH garden apartments 1955-1959. "Assessed values of single family houses in high density zones would always be far below the assessed values of garden apartments occupying the same amount of land"; even if rate of children in garden apts increased "the greater income yield from higher apartment valuations would give apartment[s] a higher economic rating."
"Apartments not only pay their own way, but make substantial contributions toward deficits caused by single family housing" p49; calculations shown
*simplified* example (but see details in original) to compare assessed values of:
50 houses in R10 zone @ $8k = $400k tax revenue for town, but avg 2 child/house = 100 children in schools
a 50-unit garden apt in R10 zone = $300-800k, but avg 0.5 child/unit = 25 children in schools, p49
Although critics of garden apts claim they lower homeowner prop values, "But reliable appraisers in almost every case have shown by records of sales in the neighborhods no depreciation of values" p49
recommends "careful limitation of the location of garden apartemtns... through zoning" in R10 zones near bus routes (Blue Hills Ave) or near business or industrial areas (Cottage Grove Road), subject to special permits p50
@shurtleffBloomfieldConnecticutMaster1961


## Bloomfield looked at its neighbor, Windsor, where residents debated whether zoning was "anti-child"
In drafting the proposed new zoning ordinance, the Plan and Zoning Commission continued to work with the problem of population density. Potential growth of the town was a major consideration in the preparation of the Comprehensive Town Plan.
new classifications:
R31 (31,250)
R20
R11 (11,250)
last winter's discussion of town plan "it was pointed out that uncontrolled gorwth of residential neighborhoods would send tax rates up. Schools, police and fire protection must follow the homes"
goal of encouraging "building of high quality small homes"
current zoning law requires larger homes in A than B or C zones "does not eet the requirements of small families with means to build a more expensive home",
allows convesion of 1-family to muti-family if lot is sufficiently large
@WindsorZoneLaw1955

Headline: Windsor: Zoning Provision Termed 'Law Against Children'
The proposed new zoning regulation was criticized Wednesday night as "legislation against children." To Irving Clark's criticism, Plan and Zoning Commission Chairman John J. Mooney Jr. answered it was "legislation against bankruptcy."
Min house size of 'basic house' is 950 sq ft, with 200 additional feet for 1 bedroom (?)
Clark: a family with one boy and one girl would have to pay $16k for new home in Windsor
Mooney, zoning chair: (indirect) "allowing smaller homes would bring in more children, raise school costs further and send taxes soaring"
Newton (for builders): rais min to 1,125 sq ft for house
Filios (pres of Windsor Federal Savings and Loan Assoc) says min "is not within the means of the average buyer" and the zoning provision "will keep out the lower income groups. That includes your children and mine in years to come"

town meeting votes 150-59 to repeal zoning commission (established 28 Aug 1935) and zoning ordinances (created 2 Oct 1936); commisioner says due to "misundertanding on the part of some persons in the town who thought they were being deprived of their rights"
@ZoningOrdinancesAre1936


## Other suburban towns also opposed zoning in 1920s...East Hartford
In other suburban towns, residents strongly opposed zoning laws. At an East Hartford public meeting in 1927, all but two of the 75 present spoke against town zoning ordinance, seeking to repeal it.  Goerge Goodwin, a member of the EH zoning commission, acknowedged that zoning laws “were enacted whiel some misunderstood them. Many have told me that the zoning code was adopted here 10 or 15 years too late; that the laws are being enforced too late and after the damage has been done.”  A resident of West Hartford, who attended on behalf of a local resident, explained that zoning in his town had [indirect quote] “been the cause of an inordinate assessment and lax levy on certain land here” which caused some property owners to sell at a loss and leave town due to what they viewed as unreasonable property taxes.  -- 19270901HC EH opposition to zoning

Avon was previously agricultural, but now residents are "lawyers, teachers, and insurance workers of Hartford; the skilled shop workers, electricians and engineers of East Hartford, New Britain and West Hartford"; 75% of Avon's workforce employed outside of town; Town planning consultant Dr Joseph Moschner says Avon area "generally attracts people in the higher income brackets people building expensive homes with large, well-landscaped lots"; Movement from Hartford, to West Hartford, to Avon. Moschner says "Avon may very well become the West Hartford of West Hartford"
@mackieAvonGrowsLiving1956

Conflicts between long-term residents and newcomers from the city were common. During a meeting of the Avon Zoning Commission in the mid-1940s, the presiding commissioner was repeatedly interrupted by a new resident. "Where in hell did you come from anyway?" asked the exasperated zoning commissioner. "West Hartford," replied the new resident. "Then why don't you do us a favor and go back there?" the zoning commissioner suggested.^[Oliver M. Thompson interview, Avon Historical Society, cited in @mackieAvonConnecticutHistorical1988, p. 254]

TODO: Describe how the three towns decided to zone land for future residential growth that would attract higher-income families. To draw meaningful comparisons between suburbs, we digitized and stitched together mid-1950s paper zoning maps from their three separate town governments, and converted their minimum-land rules into a common scale with modern labels. For example, the most exclusionary zone in this map, R-87, represents a residential zone that requires at least 87,000 square feet of land (about 2 acres) to construct a single-family home...as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1950s-otl-zoning-metro-hartford).

TODO: Note that a strict calculation might manually remove park areas (such as Pennfield state park in Bloomfield) from residential zone calculations, but towns did include them in zoning maps, so left as-is.

## EXTRAS BELOW HERE

## Hartford
By contrast, in the City of Hartford, retroactively zoning residential, commercial, and industrial development  would be extremely difficult and unwise, says expert; 19251213HC


## Wethersfield not as restrictive
TODO: compare Whitten/West Hartford exclusionary strategy with less-divisive plan from Wethersfield 1928 by Swan, which had less restrictive zoning
Also note how anti-tenement view is expresed as public health benefit
schools section refers to Wethersfield zoning areas already adopted:
A at 9 families per acre
B at 18 families per acre
for calculating projected school enrollment, it uses A and shows lack of space in future
Zoning section describes how zoning cannot do everything (prevent shacks; aesthetic issues)...
