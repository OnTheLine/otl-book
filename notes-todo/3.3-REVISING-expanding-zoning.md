## REVISING -- Expanding Zoning Across Suburbs {- #expanding-zoning}

Josiah Woods and his 1920s contemporaries never used the phrase *exclusionary zoning* when laying out their plans with minimum-land rules for West Hartford. But Connecticut town leaders were highly motivated by a fiscal equation that favored exclusion of lower-income families. In this era, local governmental services---such as public schools and streets---were funded almost entirely by local property taxes, with limited contributions from state or federal funds. Each town's primary goal was to increase its taxable property, also called the grand list, meaning the assessor's official estimate of the value of all homes, businesses, factories, and farms within its boundaries. If a town could increase its total taxable property, without sharply increasing the percentage spent on government services, property tax rates would remain stable for homeowners who voted in local elections.

But towns fiercely competed against one another to increase their property tax base. Although metropolitan Hartford functioned as a regional economy, colonial-era Connecticut [carved out towns as separate local governments](carving.html), rather than pooling resources together as a county government. During the 1920s, when mass transportation and home construction enabled Hartford residents to move to nearby suburbs and commute back to their workplaces, this movement fueled town-versus-town competition to attract higher-income residents, who could afford to purchase higher-priced homes, and pay higher property tax bills per family to local government. Towns quickly adopted zoning laws with minimum-land rules per family. More restrictive zoning rules raised the average home price by requiring a larger land purchase, and the lower population density reduced the number of families and children who needed government services such as schools. Exclusionary zoning fit perfectly into the logic of Connecticut's town government and property tax system---at least for the winners in the race to attract higher-income families, but not the losers.

### TO COME in this section {-}

This section will trace the growth of exclusionary zoning during the twentieth century, as Hartford-area suburbs competed against one another to attract higher-income families...

TODO: add narrative about the rise of zoning in Bloomfield (which hired its own expert in the 1920s to catch up with West Hartford) and Avon (were residents initially opposed zoning in the 1930s) into the 1950s...

Across these three suburbs, the most restrictive minimum-land requirement for a single-family home increased from 9,000 square feet in the 1920s to over 87,000 square feet in the 1950s, as shown in Table \@ref(tab:1950s-most-exclusive).^[TODO FIX: Avon Zoning Regulations (amended Oct 19, 1951, and Fall 1953); Bloomfield (adopted March 15, 1950); West Hartford (amended to Dec 3, 1951); adapted from @avonPresentZoningFact1954; see also Bloomfield 1958 and West Hartford 1958 zoning map legends. Assume 1958 Bloomfield R-40 minimum lot width of 150 ft based on present-day requirements.]

TODO: Describe how the three towns decided to zone land for future residential growth that would attract higher-income families. To draw meaningful comparisons between suburbs, we digitized and stitched together mid-1950s paper zoning maps from their three separate town governments, and converted their minimum-land rules into a common scale with modern labels. For example, the most exclusionary zone in this map, R-87, represents a residential zone that requires at least 87,000 square feet of land (about 2 acres) to construct a single-family home...as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1950s-otl-zoning-metro-hartford).

### Is Zoning Racist? {-}
While a century has passed since West Hartford and other Connecticut towns first enacted local zoning laws in 1924, conflicts have heated up in recent years, largely due to legal and political activism by leading organizations such as CT OCA and DesegregateCT... [describe]...  
A recurring question arises in debates between advocates of change and defenders of current policy: *Is zoning racist*?  
Example from news coverage of Woodbridge [describe...]  
"Residents and some of the zoning commissioners have expressed outrage that those asking for zoning overhaul are describing the town as racist. 'You[r application] essentially called Woodbridge a bunch of racists,' town commissioner Paul Schatz said in February... The team from the Yale clinic and Open Communities Alliance, however, has said the town has had decades to do the right thing---and that its inaction has had an impact on who can live in Woodbridge. While not explicitly racist, the zoning rules are having a disparate impact on Black and Latino people, they said."... 'Woodbridge’s zoning restrictions over the decades have driven up housing costs, and these high costs exclude many Black and Hispanic families and keep Woodbridge whiter and wealthier than the surrounding region. And so, when Woodbridge stays the same, Woodbridge stays segregated,' Anderson said. 'It doesn't have to be this way'."
^[@rabethomasHowOneBike2021]

Fair-housing advocates distinguish between the *intent* versus the *impact* of zoning laws, and historical analysis can provide some deeper insights:

First, looking back at the history of Connecticut's zoning laws in the 1920s, there is no direct evidence of *intent* to discriminate by race, religion, or nationality... In fact, zoning lawyers such as Edward Bassett ensured that overtly discriminatory labels were removed in order for zoning to survive courtroom challenges...

Second, despite its "color-blind" language, Connecticut's zoning policies from 1920s onward have clear *intent* to exclude by access to wealth. Best evidence of exclusionary zoning is minimum-land rules that favored higher-price single-family housing on large property lots, and prohibited more-affordable multi-family housing or made it uneconomic for developers to build. Even though Connecticut state law justified zoning on basis of public health and welfare, local governments gave no such reasoning when they originally drew up min-land rules in 1920s-50s, prior to pro-environmental justifications of more recent decades....

Third, exclusionary zoning of the 1920s in towns such as West Hartford expressed *intent* to block urban influences from entering suburb through *coded* language. Best evidence is photos of apartment buildings that were designed to scare suburban residents about the "undesirable" types of people who lived in them.... such as immigrants..... By its nature, coded language is partially hidden, not meant to be clearly identifiable, and plausibly deniable by author. But looking back through historical lenses at the anti-Jewish and anti-immigrant context of the 1920s, the *coded* language of Whitten's West Hartford report stands out... zoning was intended to protect current residents by attract upper-income families and keeping out lower-income...

Fourth, historical lens also reveals the relative absence of race in the 1920s-1950s zoning debates in the overwhelmingly White towns of suburban Hartford. (Different from proposed racial zoning in Atlanta, for example.) During this period, White town leaders and property owners who supported them used zoning primarily for *economic exclusion*, as a powerful legal tool to physically and socially distance neighborhoods by wealth, to separate the *haves* from the *have-nots*. In suburban Hartford, we see little evidence that zoning was used for *racial exclusion* prior to 1953 Custis case, because White towns relied on other tools of housing discrimination, such as racial steering and refusal to show property by real estate agents who belong to board (TODO: cite earlier chapter), to keep out the relatively small number of middle-class Blacks and Latinos who had funds and desire to buy homes in White suburbs.

Fifth, the long-term *impact* of zoning becomes clearer when seen through historical lenses. During the 1920s-50s, suburbs such as WH, Bloomfield, Avon created economically exclusionary zoning.... and those rules have shaped nearly a century of who benefits from rising property values, and who can afford to live where. White middle-class families that bought homes in suburbs protected by economically exclusionary zoning benefitted financially over time, which contributes to the White-Black wealth gap today..... In the US today, Black and Latino families have less wealth than White families, on average, which means that economically exclusionary zoning policies have a disproportionate *racial impact*.

[TODO: summarize answer to question "is zoning racist" by using historical insights on intent, coding, and impact...]


#### EXTRAS for racism section

century after West Hartford and other Connecticut towns approved their first zoning ordinances, many question whether or not zoning is racist. This conflict arises in heated debates like this one in Woodbridge, where a coalition organized by the Open Communities Alliance submitted an application to construct multi-family housing, and have threatened legal action if the town does not approve it (and others)..

But fair-housing advocates make a distinction between the *intent* versus the *impact* of a law. While zoning rules were originally intended to avoid referring directly to people's race, religion, or nationality, the minimum-land requirements have a direct impact on the racial composition of the town, because White families tend to be wealthier...

When looking back at the *intent* of zoning in 1920s Connecticut suburban towns like West Hartford, there's strong evidence of *exclusionary* goals.... keeping out apartment buildings like those in the city, and the lower-income people who rent them....  zoning was a powerful legal tool to physically and socially distance neighborhoods by wealth, to separate the *haves* from the *have-nots*. In the context of 1920s suburban Connecticut, zoning also aligned with contemporary anti-Jewish and anti-immigrant views of dominant White Protestants....  But there was no explicit nor implicit language about using zoning to keep Black families out of suburban Hartford towns in the 1920s, because Black migration was still a distant White fear in the future, not the on-the-ground reality of their time.... The City of Hartford had less than X % Black residents in 1920, and most of them were segregated into tenements along the Connecticut River, far from the West Hartford border, where only X Black residents lived....
But zoning prevailed as an exclusionary tool not only because it did not mention color or creed, but because its *coded* targets of exclusion evolved over the decades.... and it became a powerful yet "color-blind" means of preventing lower-income Black, Puerto Rican, and White families from moving into the town in future decades....[transition to next chapter?]

TODO DECIDE if this is worth adding: Manville's interpretation: "R1 first proliferated after the Supreme Court struck down racial zoning in 1917’s Buchanan v. Warley decision. Buchanan made single-family mandates appealing because they maintained racial segregation without racial language. Forcing consumers to buy land in bulk made it harder for lower income people, and therefore most non-White people, to enter affluent places. R1 let prices discriminate when laws could not (Trounstine, 2018; Weiss, 1987). Contemporary observers denounced this regime of backdoor segregation, but in 1926 the Supreme Court upheld it. In Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co. (1926), the court tacitly excused R1’s implicit racism by validating its explicit classism. Cities could prohibit apartments, the court said, because apartments were nuisances: “mere parasites” on the value and character of single-family homes. In Euclid’s wake, R1 became a quiet weapon of the White and wealthy in their campaign to live amid but not among the non-White and poor (Danielson, 1976; Rothstein, 2017; Trounstine, 2018)." ^[@manvilleViewpointItTime2019, p. 2]

Optimists believed thet people would leave the 'unhealthful tenements' for the good air of the country, only a ten cent fare away from the city. Real estate would boom and there would be a growth in population as new one-family hosues were built. Fear was also expressed, that local businesses would lose out as residents used the trolley to go to Hartford to shop." p92 Trolley line increased Italian immigration into Bloomfield's East Side in 1920
dedication of new state highway, Rt 189, through center after WWI, with quickened pace of life from auto (development spurred by war) "Increasingly, Bloomfield became a commuter town, as larger numbers of people looked to Hartford for employment, many of them in the insurance companies." p103
"In the late 1920s, efforts wer made to entice urban residents to Bloomfield. The town was given wide publicity as an attractive suburb of Hartford. In 1928..the town boasted of its residential character - no manufacturing. Emphasis was on fine estates and homes, 'plush' growth, and belief that 'land values will rise by leaps and bounds'.... The Blue Hills area, adjacent to Hartford, was described as 'removed from the center' a section of houses of the 'bungalow' type. Water lines were being laid, a high school site had been purchased, and the town had hired a professional to draw up a zoning plan. The zoning regulations, adopted in 1929, are an example of far-sighted vision and planning. Crucial to its plans was the location of the proposed state highway through town [Rt 189 dedicated in 1935] Its continuation from West Hartford thorugh the center of Bloomfield was vital in bringing to Bloomfield the kind of growth that had been sought." p107 [by whom?] "Despite the Depression, the 1937 Town Report noted that more new residences were under construction than at any previous time in the town's history." p107 the post-WWII pop boom "might have left Bloomfield only a 'bedroom' town. Visionary thinking and intense efforts to locate industry here overcame that eventuality. Growth in numbers of schoolage children by 1944 required a new school, a story repeated several times over the next decades." 1947 disc of housing developments; industrial zone set aside 1948 demand for recreational services since "Suburbia suffered from a lack of cultural and recreational opportunities readily available in cities." p110

1928 Bloomfield Town Plan by Herbert Swan
Bloomfield will always be "a residence suburb" because "people who come to live in town must find their livelihood in Hartford" and the town must accept this fact, p.1
Hartford residential areas are almost completely built up, wth few vacant lots, so needs to capitalize on its location to widening urban community; with intellgient growth "its character will become progressively more distinctive and distinguishable from neighboring suburbs" p2
"The growth of Bloomfield will always depend to an exceptional degree upon its relationship to Hartford. The more intimately it can develop its plan with that of Hartford, the more growth Bloomfield will enjoy, as the growing suburan population of Hartford will undoubtedly seek out residence localities which, other things being equal, will be as near in the matter of time distance as possible to the business district of Hartford" p5
prepare major thoroughfare from Hartford to Bloomfield: lists 13 connector streets, some to be widened, p6
Land subdivisions: so far, very small proportion of land has been subdivided, but "very little good" can be said of current subdivisions, with max lots for developers but no major/minor streets and connecting roads, p. 18
"The zoning regulations in Bloomfield demand...." [unclear if they already exist, or should exist; probably the latter]
A zone = min land 5000 sq ft per family, 50 foot width (but town should demand 6250 sq ft), p19-20
(later B zone is mentioned, but no min land req given here)

Y., to develop a tract of land off Blue Hills Avenue and construct about 120 duplex-type houses... each unit would house two families, each of whom would hold title to the side in which it lived"
each duplex lot would be about 11k sq ft, meaning 5.5k per family; if granted, will become "D" residential zone; already has city sewers and water

## East Hartford
In other suburban towns, residents strongly opposed zoning laws. At an East Hartford public meeting in 1927, all but two of the 75 present spoke against town zoning ordinance, seeking to repeal it.  Goerge Goodwin, a member of the EH zoning commission, acknowedged that zoning laws “were enacted whiel some misunderstood them. Many have told me that the zoning code was adopted here 10 or 15 years too late; that the laws are being enforced too late and after the damage has been done.”  A resident of West Hartford, who attended on behalf of a local resident, explained that zoning in his town had [indirect quote] “been the cause of an inordinate assessment and lax levy on certain land here” which caused some property owners to sell at a loss and leave town due to what they viewed as unreasonable property taxes.  -- 19270901HC EH opposition to zoning

Conflicts between long-term residents and newcomers from the city were common. During a meeting of the Avon Zoning Commission in the mid-1940s, the presiding commissioner was repeatedly interrupted by a new resident. "Where in hell did you come from anyway?" asked the exasperated zoning commissioner. "West Hartford," replied the new resident. "Then why don't you do us a favor and go back there?" the zoning commissioner suggested.^[Oliver M.

## Is Zoning Racist? [ADDITION]

Black middle-class homeowners sometimes faced suburban zoning obstacles that led them to question whether or not they were treated fairly. In the early 1950s, Lemuel and Ione Custis lived in Hartford's North End and belonged to one of the city's best-known Black families. Lemuel's father, Charles Leslie Custis, was born into slavery in Virginia and later moved to Hartford in 1882 after reading that the city of 45,000 people had 13 banks. "I decided right then and there that if Hartford had to have all those banks to take care of the money people had, it must be a good place to live," Charles reasoned. He eventually secured a job as a nighttime elevator operator at the Aetna Life Insurance Company in 1888, where company president Morgan G. Bulkeley was impressed with his "courtesy and judgment" and later appointed him as the receptionist in the executive offices. His son Lemuel graduated from Hartford Public High School and Howard University, then returned to Hartford to become the city's first Black police officer in 1939. During World War II, Lemuel graduated in the first class of Black aviators known as the Tuskegee Airmen, flew more than 90 combat missions, and received the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism. Ione, his wife, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, and both of them held positions in the Connecticut state government. Like many White middle-class couples, they dreamed about owning a single-family home in the suburbs.^[@CustisAetnaLife1950; @PolicemanGraduatesFlying1942; @CustisListingsPrice1953; @IoneCustisObituary1991; @filloHumbleManWho2005; @sokolAllEyesAre2014, pp. 62-63]

TODO: Add photo of Lemuel, and note absence of photos of Ione

In 1951, Lemuel and Ione Custis purchased vacant land to construct a home home in Wethersfield, a nearly all-White suburb located south of Hartford. At first, the town government designated their land as a B-zone with minimum-land *and* minimum-floorspace requirements. They hired an architect to draw up plans for a two-story house to meet these requirements, with 750 square feet on the first floor and 720 square feet on the second floor, for a total of 1,470 interior square feet. The town granted them a building permit. However, before construction began, the town re-zoned their area to A-1 and raised the minimums to 900 square feet on the first floor and 450 square feet on the second floor, for a total of 1,350 interior square feet. Although the total interior floorspace for the Custis's home plan met the new minimum requirement, their first-floor layout fell short by 150 square feet. The act of re-zoning the neighborhood blocked them from building an affordable home.^[The Custis family property was located at 563 Nott Street, Wethersfield, and the town's B-zone minimum-floorspace requirements were 550 square feet on the first floor and 300 square feet on the second floor, for a total of 850 interior square feet. @NegroWarHero1953]

Ione Custis petitioned the Wethersfield Zoning Board of Appeals in late 1952 to request permission to build their home as it was originally designed. Town officials heard her case and soon granted her request on a "hardship" basis, which allowed construction to begin. But a group of homeowners strongly objected and filed a lawsuit against town officials, claiming that they acted "illegally, arbitrarily in an abuse of their discretion" by granting Ione Custis permission to construct a home with less than the minimum floorspace required for A-1 zones. Were these White property owners acting against a home that was a bit too small---or the skin color of their new neighbors? Lemuel Custis reached out NAACP executive director Walter White, who offered assistance from the civil rights organization. After a six month delay, the judged ruled in favor of town officials, stating that they had reached a reasonable decision, which finally allowed the Custis family to build their home. Black newspapers around the nation also celebrated their victory. Lemuel thanked Walter White for the NAACP's support, and noted that he felt "some satisfaction in realizing that because of our experiences, perhaps another Negro family in Connecticut will not have to battle nearly two years to have their basic rights affirmed."^[Homeowners who filed a lawsuit against the Custis decision were led by Grace A. Pratt of 621 Nott Street, who resided one block from the construction site. @WethersfieldYouthGovernment1952; @WethersfieldZoneBoard1953; @WethersfieldAlcornGive1953; @WethersfieldGovernorSigns1953; @NegroWarHero1953; @custisLetterWalterWhite1953; @ConnecticutVetBuilding1953; @BarsVetBuilding1953]

The 1950s Custis case pushes us to think carefully about how to respond to the question: *Is zoning racist?*

- The *intent* of residential zoning in suburban Connecticut is *exclusionary* because minimum-floorspace requirements of upper-level zones require more expensive home construction and greater access to wealth than lower-level zones.
- The *impact* of exclusionary zoning disproportionately affects Black families, who on average have had less access to higher-earning jobs. Lemuel and Ione Custis were exceptions because they managed to overcome structural barriers and enter middle-class jobs in the 1950s....
- While exclusionary zoning can be a government-sponsored tool for housing discrimination, the Custis family was not the target of government-sponsored racism in this specific case. To the contrary, town officials granted their request to build a home that was slightly smaller than new zoning rules required, but met the spirit of the rule because they had sufficient wealth to build a home...
- Even if the group of White homeowners who objected to the Custis home were motivated by racism, town officials and the judicial system supported the middle-class Black couple rather than their middle-class White opponents.
- As middle-class Black homebuyers, the Custis family and their civil rights allies did *not* question whether Connecticut local governments had the right to enact exclusionary zoning according to wealth. To the contrary, they *accepted* the underlying premise of minimum-land and minimum-floorspace requirements in the suburbs, and only questioned whether the system treated them fairly by granting them the same individual property rights enjoyed by middle-class White homeowners. Neither the Custis family, nor the NAACP, nor the White-run town government, nor the White neighbors challenged the class-based barriers to homeownership...



## West Hartford expansion

1933 WH added new classifications "for the protection of large homes requiring more area"
AAA single houses, min land 18000 sq ft, lot width 100 ft
AA single houses, min land 12000 sq ft, lot width 80 ft
@westhartfordReportZoningCommission1934, p. 119

town approved new zoning regs Aug 6th 1945 as the "first revision of the regulations since the inception of zoning in 1924"; new map shown publicly and approval expected in spring 1946; all E changed to D; creation of Business 1 zones
@westhartfordReportZoningCommission1946, pp. 48-49

WH town council adopts new zoning May 6, 1946, expanding A-E range to AAA, AA, A, B, C, D, G residence district; revisions on map up to 1951 shows changes from 1930 such as:
much of the B-grade land in southwest area (Wood Pond) has been shifted to A-grade
most of north and northwest section has shifted from A to AA grade
most of area west of Bishop’s Corners shifted from B grade to AA grade
area around Hartford golf club shifted from B grade to AA grade
see decreasing or degrading residential area on southeast side, bordering Hartford
TO DO: look for HC or WHN articles around May 6 1946

1968
"Better Neighborhoods Through...
Enforcement of Housing Codes and Zoning Regulations"
"Good neighborhoods in the Town will remain through the continued upgrading by your Town goverment of the residential zoning of some 22,121 residential units and the enforcement of housing codes, which protect the appearance and value of residential property"

## West Hartford 1970s
find quote: West Hartford 1970s mayor Ellsworth Grant says no racial discrimination; blacks and puerto ricans simply can't afford to live here;
first, his words ignored racial steering....
second, his words ignored WH's intentional use of exclusionary zoning to keep out affordable multi-family housing...

Finish with 1970s WH mayor quote
FROM EI FAIR HOUSING AT ITS WORST
Sec 24: Profiles and comments on economics/housing
1973 EI survey shows only 100 low income family units of public housing (with 21 minority families) in all suburban towns in Cap Region, but 2680 such units in Hartford (with 2331 minority families); 99% of all minority families in low income public housing are in Hartford low income housing p130
Ellsworth Grant, Mayor WH “matter of economics” (minorities not welcome, but it’s economic) quote; 18 Oct 1973 p130
**Report counters this mythical “neutral ‘color-blind’ barrier” of economics” economic barrier:
Table shows number of moderately valued homes (less than $25k in 1970) in several towns, and percentage increase in value over decade) ****
“The fact is that there are more than 10 moderately valued homes in the suburbs (*less than $25,000) in the suburbs for every one such home in the City of Hartford, but there are almost 7 black individuals in the City for every one black individual in the suburbs. Why don’t minorities just buy these cheaper homes if de facto segregation is merely ‘a matter of economics’?” p131
“The answer is: Most of the moderately priced homes (particularly those ‘cheaper’ homes in expensive neighborhoods) never get into the newspaper advertisements or through the MLS channels in time for minority home buyers to be aware of them. Real estate agents and companies keep formal (written) or informal (mental) lists of customers wanting $25-$30,000 homes and quickly negotiate the sale bad on privileged information, social contacts, family relationships, etc. Minority families are not on these formal or informal lists. Clearly, it is not the price of homes that locks blacks out of suburbs.” **** p131
Also, people locked into city could not invest in suburban property that appreciated twice as high a rate as city property p131
