## REVISING Expanding Zoning


DECIDE how much to expand on Avon, Bloomfield, West Hartford. Chronology says start with Bloomfield...





Although Connecticut town leaders hired planners to guide their decision-making, no one could guarantee what the future would hold. During periods of rapid growth in the 1920s or 1950s, experts often made population projections that in hindsight appear preposterous.
Zoning policies also required town leaders to decide how much land to set aside for industrial and commercial space, or mixed residential-commercial space, and to find ways to entice developers to build in their own, rather than a competing town next door.

Bloomfield also demonstrates that raising minimum-land zoning requirements does not automatically lead to successful growth.
- if towns made zoning very exclusive, only wealthy buyers would be able to afford larger property lots, which would only slightly increase the overall population and demand for local governmental services. However, if zoning became too exclusive and exceeded the market demand for homes in that price range, unsold land would remain vacant and not generate sufficient property tax revenue. Unlike the saying "build it and they will come," town governments could not assume a stance of "zone it and developers will build."






## Zoning Bloomfield: The Booming Commuter Town
trolley line to Center built by Italian laborers and finally opened 1909, with major celebration p90 opening of original 13-stanza poem by Chandler Miller, titled: ON to bloomfield, the Suburbs in the Hills On to bloomfield has, for many a year, Been the cry, till now the trolley is here On to Bloomfield, with its vales and its rills On to Bloomfield, the suburb in the hills "The banquet in the town hall was followed by speeches which revealed some ambivalence, looking at both good and bad features of the 'invasion of the first electric car.' Optimists believed thet people would leave the 'unhealthful tenements' for the good air of the country, only a ten cent fare away from the city. Real estate would boom and there would be a growth in population as new one-family hosues were built. Fear was also expressed, that local businesses would lose out as residents used the trolley to go to Hartford to shop." p92 Trolley line increased Italian immigration into Bloomfield's East Side in 1920

 "Increasingly, Bloomfield became a commuter town, as larger numbers of people looked to Hartford for employment, many of them in the insurance companies." p103
"In the late 1920s, efforts wer made to entice urban residents to Bloomfield. The town was given wide publicity as an attractive suburb of Hartford. In 1928..the town boasted of its residential character - no manufacturing. Emphasis was on fine estates and homes, 'plush' growth, and belief that 'land values will rise by leaps and bounds'.... The Blue Hills area, adjacent to Hartford, was described as 'removed from the center' a section of houses of the 'bungalow' type. Water lines were being laid, a high school site had been purchased, and the town had hired a professional to draw up a zoning plan. The zoning regulations, adopted in 1929, are an example of far-sighted vision and planning. " p107
 "Despite the Depression, the 1937 Town Report noted that more new residences were under construction than at any previous time in the town's history." p107 the post-WWII pop boom "might have left Bloomfield only a 'bedroom' town. Visionary thinking and intense efforts to locate industry here overcame that eventuality. Growth in numbers of schoolage children by 1944 required a new school, a story repeated several times over the next decades."  p110 @wintonburyhistoricalsocietyWintonburyBloomfield1983

Bloomfield became one of Connecticut's first towns to create a Planning Commission in 1917, which supervised the layout or new roads and housing subdivisions p193
Bloomfield created a Zoning Commission in 1926 WHS p193

Bloomfield voted to form Zoning Commission in Aug 1926
Zoning has been topic for past two years; several years ago Blue Hills land developed by real estate promoters "As a consequence, all kinds and classes of houses were built"
@WillVoteZoning1926; @ZoneCommissionFive1926
April 1927 The town of Bloomfield has created a zoning commission in order to get a comprehensive town plan and zoning ordinance. In accordance with a vote of the town, it has engaged Herbert S. Swan of New York as expert.
@ZoningProblemsBe1927

Nov 1927
The zoning committee of the town held a meeting at the town building Wednesday evening at which Herbert Swan, zoning expert, outlined the zoning regulations which are being drafted and also submitted a layout of Roberts Park. Mr. Swan is to prepare a survey in detail of his proposed layout of Roberts Park.

June 1928 Bloomfield's Popularity As City's New Suburb Gains Hold in Hartford
real estate development opportunity article, which emphasizes large estates on Bloomfield Avenue and elsewhere; recent decision to install water mains to replace individual water wells;
current Bloomfield High School occupies 2nd floor of Jerome Ave grammar school, with plan to build a 400-student high school building soon, pending bond issue
Herbert Swan city planner is currently working on zoning plan for future growth of town
Blue Hills section is a "community of thrifty home owners" but most are "bungalow type" so not expected to match quality of residential construction on Bloomfield Ave
@BloomfieldPopularityCity1928

"The eyes of real estate men and those seeking homes in a suburb near a large city are turning to Bloomfield, which holds a unique position in Connecticut in that it is a strictly residential town and has no manufacturing whatever."
$2M in building permits (but mostly St Thomas Seminary)
about 900 enrolled in school; 5 percent gain per year
Blue Hills section expanded and six-room addition added to school, to make 14 rooms; also purchased 7 acres for high school site
recent creation of zoning commission with NYC expert Herbert Swan
@BloomfieldBuildingProgram1928

1928 Bloomfield Town Plan by Herbert Swan
Bloomfield will always be "a residence suburb" because "people who come to live in town must find their livelihood in Hartford" and the town must accept this fact, p.1
Hartford residential areas are almost completely built up, wth few vacant lots, so needs to capitalize on its location to widening urban community; with intellgient growth "its character will become progressively more distinctive and distinguishable from neighboring suburbs" p2
"The growth of Bloomfield will always depend to an exceptional degree upon its relationship to Hartford. The more intimately it can develop its plan with that of Hartford, the more growth Bloomfield will enjoy, as the growing suburan population of Hartford will undoubtedly seek out residence localities which, other things being equal, will be as near in the matter of time distance as possible to the business district of Hartford" p5
prepare major thoroughfare from Hartford to Bloomfield: lists 13 connector streets, some to be widened, p6
Land subdivisions: so far, very small proportion of land has been subdivided, but "very little good" can be said of current subdivisions, with max lots for developers but no major/minor streets and connecting roads, p. 18
"The zoning regulations in Bloomfield demand...." [unclear if they already exist, or should exist; probably the latter]
A zone = min land 5000 sq ft per family, 50 foot width (but town should demand 6250 sq ft), p19-20
(later B zone is mentioned, but no min land req given here)
@swanBloomfieldTownPlan1928

Zoning proposed April 1929
Bloomfield Zoning Commission will hold public hearing April 8th on proposed zoning ordinance; "The proposed ordinance and maps defining the zoning districts will be on file for inspection... at the Town Building"
@BloomfieldProposedZoning1929

Zoning enforced 1929 - Bloomfield's new zoning laws, which became operative on April 12, 1929, are receiving their first court test by virtue of an action brought by the town against Josephine De Costin of Bloomfield, who is seeking to erect a gasoline station on West Street, a state highway, which runs through a residential area
Judge granted injunction to stop gas station @BloomfieldActionDecide1929

1929 zoning regs "made Bloomfield among the earliest of the zoned towns in the state"; planning for industrial parks, schools according to pop growth p1
@shurtleffBloomfieldConnecticutMaster1961

Bloomfield did not shy away from affordable two-family housing in 1942
Within the next week the Bloomfield Town Plan and Zoning Commission will hold a public hearing on the application of the Harry L. Osias Realty Company of Brooklyn, N. Y., to develop a tract of land off Blue Hills Avenue and construct about 120 duplex-type houses... each unit would house two families, each of whom would hold title to the side in which it lived"
each duplex lot would be about 11k sq ft, meaning 5.5k per family; if granted, will become "D" residential zone; already has city sewers and water
@HearingPlannedProposal1942

1955 zoning plan revised
MDC is just beginning to install new sanitary sewers and water mains in heavily populated Bloomfield Center; "no large subdivisions will be encouraged in areas not served by MDC sewer and water systems" so western town dev will wait
about 90% of Bloomfield is zoned for residence: R10, R15, R20, R30, R40 combined; town zoning ordinances revised in 1955 with retired MIT Prof Flavel Shurtleff; new General Life Insurance Co building raised grand list; more fiscal details, school projections
@jensonBloomfield10YearChallenge1956

1959-60 reflections about 1950s growth and large-lot zones
$5M bond issues for 1955 senior hs, 1959 junior hs, 3 elem schools, sites for 2 more schools p2
135% pop increase from 1950-1960 highest in Capitol Region except Vernon; caused by "good building land next to capital city, industrial expansion resulting in the low tax rate, and forward-looking intelligent management"
pop projections from Peach report, with ultimate pop of 45k imagined
other nearby towns still growing; "Minimum lot requirements in residential zones are much higher in Bloomfield than in any of the three towns in Table 5"; R80, R40, R30 in western area, so ultimate pop fig "can be kept much lower thna in any of the towns in the Table if the area requirements for housing lots in the zoning regulations are not substantially lowered." p9
Concern about high room occupancy in Blue Hills area according to census data; housing code enforcement needed p11
"Bloomfield has almost no multiple housing. There are some two-family houses in the R10 zone but nothing that could be classified as an apartment or a tenement house. Garden apartments are being discussed" see 1959 memo attached; also amendment to allow apartments as special exceptiosn in R10 and R15 zones p11
School sites: acc to pop projections, rec 2 new school sites of at least 50 acres each in tract 7D before 1970
Zoning ordinance adopted 1929, revised 1950 with new map and definitions. A (15k) B (10k) and C (7.5k) replaced with R30, R20, R15, R10. During 1950s, added R80 and R40 p21
@shurtleffBloomfieldConnecticutMaster1961

1959-61 proposal to allow low-density garden apartments
Apdx C Garden Apt memo (prepared in 1959 and attached to this 1961 report for convenience): developers advocate for low-volume garden apartments. A 1954 Windsor study found no vacancies in 918 garden apartments in Hartford, East Hartford, Manchester, West Hartford, Wethersfield. Other towns are considering allowing them in zoning. "Education costs, the biggest single item in local budgets are much less, since the average is less than one child per family [in garden apartments] as against two or even three for families occupying single family units." Windsor 1954 report found avg 0.37 children per family in garden apartments (ranging from 0.2 to 0.6) p47-48
more recent comparison of Loomis Drive WH garden apartments 1955-1959. "Assessed values of single family houses in high density zones would always be far below the assessed values of garden apartments occupying the same amount of land"; even if rate of children in garden apts increased "the greater income yield from higher apartment valuations would give apartment[s] a higher economic rating."
"Apartments not only pay their own way, but make substantial contributions toward deficits caused by single family housing" p49; calculations shown
*simplified* example (but see details in original) to compare assessed values of:
50 houses in R10 zone @ $8k = $400k tax revenue for town, but avg 2 child/house = 100 children in schools
a 50-unit garden apt in R10 zone = $300-800k, but avg 0.5 child/unit = 25 children in schools, p49
Although critics of garden apts claim they lower homeowner prop values, "But reliable appraisers in almost every case have shown by records of sales in the neighborhods no depreciation of values" p49
recommends "careful limitation of the location of garden apartemtns... through zoning" in R10 zones near bus routes (Blue Hills Ave) or near business or industrial areas (Cottage Grove Road), subject to special permits p50
@shurtleffBloomfieldConnecticutMaster1961


## Bloomfield looked at its neighbor, Windsor, where residents debated whether zoning was "anti-child"
In drafting the proposed new zoning ordinance, the Plan and Zoning Commission continued to work with the problem of population density. Potential growth of the town was a major consideration in the preparation of the Comprehensive Town Plan.
new classifications:
R31 (31,250)
R20
R11 (11,250)
last winter's discussion of town plan "it was pointed out that uncontrolled gorwth of residential neighborhoods would send tax rates up. Schools, police and fire protection must follow the homes"
goal of encouraging "building of high quality small homes"
current zoning law requires larger homes in A than B or C zones "does not eet the requirements of small families with means to build a more expensive home",
allows convesion of 1-family to muti-family if lot is sufficiently large
@WindsorZoneLaw1955

Headline: Windsor: Zoning Provision Termed 'Law Against Children'
The proposed new zoning regulation was criticized Wednesday night as "legislation against children." To Irving Clark's criticism, Plan and Zoning Commission Chairman John J. Mooney Jr. answered it was "legislation against bankruptcy."
Min house size of 'basic house' is 950 sq ft, with 200 additional feet for 1 bedroom (?)
Clark: a family with one boy and one girl would have to pay $16k for new home in Windsor
Mooney, zoning chair: (indirect) "allowing smaller homes would bring in more children, raise school costs further and send taxes soaring"
Newton (for builders): rais min to 1,125 sq ft for house
Filios (pres of Windsor Federal Savings and Loan Assoc) says min "is not within the means of the average buyer" and the zoning provision "will keep out the lower income groups. That includes your children and mine in years to come"

## Zoning Avon: The Reluctant Agricultural Town

## Avon initially approved then rejected zoning in 1930s
Further outward, the farming community of Avon named its first committee to study zoning in 1934; selectmen appoint cmte "to make a study of zoning systems in other towns with a view to institutiong a zoning system in the Town of Avon"
@AvonNamesCommittee1934

town meeting votes 150-59 to repeal zoning commission (established 28 Aug 1935) and zoning ordinances (created 2 Oct 1936); commisioner says due to "misundertanding on the part of some persons in the town who thought they were being deprived of their rights"
@ZoningOrdinancesAre1936


## Other suburban towns also opposed zoning in 1920s...East Hartford
In other suburban towns, residents strongly opposed zoning laws. At an East Hartford public meeting in 1927, all but two of the 75 present spoke against town zoning ordinance, seeking to repeal it.  Goerge Goodwin, a member of the EH zoning commission, acknowedged that zoning laws “were enacted whiel some misunderstood them. Many have told me that the zoning code was adopted here 10 or 15 years too late; that the laws are being enforced too late and after the damage has been done.”  A resident of West Hartford, who attended on behalf of a local resident, explained that zoning in his town had [indirect quote] “been the cause of an inordinate assessment and lax levy on certain land here” which caused some property owners to sell at a loss and leave town due to what they viewed as unreasonable property taxes.  -- 19270901HC EH opposition to zoning


### Avon leaders try zoning a second time...
Avon town leaders tried a second time by appointing a zoning board in March 31, 1939 @mackieAvonConnecticutHistorical1988, p. 246

celebrates two years of zoning in Avon (since 1939); $300k increase in home building; 75 homes built in two years; Zoning Comission chief objective: "making sure that no 'gypsy camps' get started in the town, that no careless, hurried, shack-like building goes on to pull down the value of surrounding property"
thoughts about improving school facilities
Zoning Comm "set lot minimums at 100 x 150 feet" = 15,000 sq feet (1/3 acre)
@AvonReapsBenefits1941

With the encouragement of wealthy property owners, Avon town leaders enforced their zoning laws.

### Avon leaders pushed more exclusive zoning in 1950s as town attracted wealthier families

Avon was previously agricultural, but now residents are "lawyers, teachers, and insurance workers of Hartford; the skilled shop workers, electricians and engineers of East Hartford, New Britain and West Hartford"; 75% of Avon's workforce employed outside of town; Town planning consultant Dr Joseph Moschner says Avon area "generally attracts people in the higher income brackets people building expensive homes with large, well-landscaped lots"; Movement from Hartford, to West Hartford, to Avon. Moschner says "Avon may very well become the West Hartford of West Hartford"
@mackieAvonGrowsLiving1956

Conflicts between long-term residents and newcomers from the city were common. During a meeting of the Avon Zoning Commission in the mid-1940s, the presiding commissioner was repeatedly interrupted by a new resident. "Where in hell did you come from anyway?" asked the exasperated zoning commissioner. "West Hartford," replied the new resident. "Then why don't you do us a favor and go back there?" the zoning commissioner suggested.^[Oliver M. Thompson interview, Avon Historical Society, cited in @mackieAvonConnecticutHistorical1988, p. 254]

Although Avon's planners labeled their maps as zoning for density, a more accurate description was that they were zoning for dollars.


Sept-Oct 1957
150 people attended 4-hour public hearing on "proposed new zoning and subdivision regulations" for Avon; notes made of all objections and criticisms, and commission will review and hold another public hearing before final adoption

Avon 1964 Revised Zoning Map
originally Sept 1958, with multiple revisions
East side = mostly RU-2A rural zones (undefined on map)
West side = mixture of R-40, R-30, R-15, Business, Industrial, etc.

TODO: confirm if my analysis of Avon zoning matches notes from Anika Singh Lemar in @boggsYourFairShare2020

1948  15,000 sq ft minimum parcel
1951 rezoned area west of Farmington River to min 2 acre parcels
1953 rezoned area east of Farmington River to min 30,000 sq ft
1957 rezoned portions of eastern area to min 40,000 sq ft; anticipates possibility of apartments by conditional permit
by 1967 vast majority of Avon is zoned for 1 acre and 2 acre lots; discrete areas zoned for commercial and industrial


## West Hartford expands zoning

1933 WH added new classifications "for the protection of large homes requiring more area"
AAA single houses, min land 18000 sq ft, lot width 100 ft
AA single houses, min land 12000 sq ft, lot width 80 ft
@westhartfordReportZoningCommission1934, p. 119

town approved new zoning regs Aug 6th 1945 as the "first revision of the regulations since the inception of zoning in 1924"; new map shown publicly and approval expected in spring 1946; all E changed to D; creation of Business 1 zones
@westhartfordReportZoningCommission1946, pp. 48-49

WH town council adopts new zoning May 6, 1946, expanding A-E range to AAA, AA, A, B, C, D, G residence district; revisions on map up to 1951 shows changes from 1930 such as:
much of the B-grade land in southwest area (Wood Pond) has been shifted to A-grade
most of north and northwest section has shifted from A to AA grade
most of area west of Bishop’s Corners shifted from B grade to AA grade
area around Hartford golf club shifted from B grade to AA grade
see decreasing or degrading residential area on southeast side, bordering Hartford
TO DO: look for HC or WHN articles around May 6 1946

West Hartford zoning rules prohibit realtor from doing business on phone in his A zone home; Albert E. Rondeau, realtor, who was found guilty on a charge of conducting business at his home in South Main Street in violation of the town zoning regulations and fined $1 in Town Court last Monday has been granted permission to continue activities he has... @RealtorMayContinue1944

## CT expands justification for zoning
TODO: determine year(s) when major changes are made
CT legislators continually expanded the legal justification for zoning
Originally in 1923/1925 TODO Check text: health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community...conserving value...
By 1957 (or 67?), TODO see Ch 124 and/or 126: avoid undue concentration of population... adequate transportation, water, sewerage, schools... encouraging the most appropriate use of alnd... character of the area and its peculiar suitability for particular uses. Local towns carefully included these quotes in their local zoning ordinances to provide legal justification if disuptes arose in court.... @avonTownAvonSubdivision1967




## EXTRAS BELOW HERE

## Hartford
By contrast, in the City of Hartford, retroactively zoning residential, commercial, and industrial development  would be extremely difficult and unwise, says expert; 19251213HC


## Wethersfield not as restrictive
TODO: compare Whitten/West Hartford exclusionary strategy with less-divisive plan from Wethersfield 1928 by Swan, which had less restrictive zoning
Also note how anti-tenement view is expresed as public health benefit
schools section refers to Wethersfield zoning areas already adopted:
A at 9 families per acre
B at 18 families per acre
for calculating projected school enrollment, it uses A and shows lack of space in future
Zoning section describes how zoning cannot do everything (prevent shacks; aesthetic issues)...
