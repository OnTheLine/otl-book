On Writing about Race (and Why Rules Don't Always Work)

When talking and writing about race and racism, we make decisions about the language we use, meaning the rules we follow to communicate with one another. Language reflects power relationships: we can use words to respect and connect with others, or we can use them to denigrate and dominate over others. 

When we value respect and connection, we often adopt and follow rules about the language we use to talk about racial identity or racist social structures. But a problem is that these language rules sometimes conflict with each other. Some examples:

*Principle 1: Call people by the names they wish to be called.* Based on the simple principle of respect, when a person prefers a certain name or identity, we should follow that.... 

*Principle 2: People do not always agree on the same group identity, and they may change over time.* 

In fact, during the two decades that passed while writing this book, we can see several examples of language rules about race that different people adopted in order to show respect, and ways that these rules did not necessarily work out smoothly...

Capitalization rules -- when did AP and NYT change

Group identity rules -- Black, BIPOC, Hispanic, Latinix, Latine, etc

People-first language rules -- describe example (people with disabilities) -- but when we follow the first principle and actually listen to how people describe themselves and their movements, we notice how they don't follow the rules

When speaking and writing about both the past and present, as historians do, following the rules above becomes even more complicated.... 

Quote people exactly as they spoke rule -- 

For example, when quoting someone in the past, if they use "X" changing that to a more modern-sounding "Y" would violate the first principle, so keep quotes intact. Thurgood Marshall example... but our modern-day writing about the past needs to use present-day language
