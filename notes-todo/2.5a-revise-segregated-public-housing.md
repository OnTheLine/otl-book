## Racially Segregated Wartime Public Housing
- Many young people today are surprised to hear of a time when "public housing" was a highly desired commodity by Whites. . . Go back to 1940s/50s when housing was scarce. . . Many called for government to intervene in the private housing market by creating more publicly-funded affordable housing. . . Successful because these efforts were tied to wartime industry. . .(check and cite Picture Windows book)

- Main arguments:
- As the nation prepared to enter World War II in the early 1940s, Hartford-area city and suburban governments used federal funds to build public housing for wartime workers that increased racial segregation above pre-existing levels in their areas.
- Local government housing authorities pushed Black residents into high-density housing projects concentrated in the city's North End, but welcomed White residents into lower-density public housing scattered along the city's edges and in suburban towns.
- Suburban governments strenously fought federal attempts to allow Black defense workers in suburban public housing and succeeded in keeping it for Whites only, despite the war's goal of fighting Nazism and preserving democracy.
- After the war ended, some suburban governments sought to restore private home ownership by demolishing public housing projects, or selling higher-quality single- and two-family units in the private marketplace. These public policy decisions benefitted middle-class White homebuyers that real estate brokers welcomed into the suburbs, but not Black and lower-income White residents that suburbs sought to keep out.

### Hartford narrative

In the City of Hartford, public housing originally began as solution proposed by 1930s Slum Clearance efforts

1934 Mayor Spellacy (TODO: check) created Mayor's Housing Committee to study slum clearance,

The Hartford Slum Clearance Committee reported in 1934 “the Negroes due to their low position in the social and economic groups have been forced to live in whatever tenements were abandoned and no longer desired by the white families.”
@hartfordslumclearancestudycommitteeReportSlumClearance1934
@hartfordslumclearancestudycommitteeMapPartPlan1934
but city "never undertook the slum clearance and low-income housing program planned then" @HousingSurveyHartford1938

Hartford Mayor Spellacy appointed Hartford Housing Authority in 1938, with coalition of business (Aetna VP), labor (union rep), and Black (Rev Hopes as "Negro rep") @HousingBodyAppointed1938; @MayorTextNames1938
HHA chair Stillman Westbrook, who previously served on the Mayor's Housing Committee in 1934, quickly requested that US Housing Authority earmark $5M in loans for Hartford under the Federal Housing Act  @wimerWestbrookLaysCity1938; @wimerLonerganHopefulMillion1938
Federal loan would pay for 90 percent of the costs of public housing owned by the USHA, and local governments would need to pay for remaining 10 percent...
USHA earmarked $4.5M in mid-1938 "after the city has demonstrated the need of such a program and prepared a project" @LocalFloodRestoration1938
Although Hartford leaders sought to use these funds to rebuild East Side riverfront neighborhood after devastating 1938 hurricane, USHA funds could not be used to renovate private property, and not in a flood area; only public housing projects on newly designated sites and "equivalent elimination" of low-quality housing elsewhere in city. @FloodAreasInspected1938
HHA arranged for WPA Survey of housing conditions in neighborhoods across the city @ThreeFoldWPASurvey1938

PROBLEMS
Mayor Thomas J. Spellacy declared Saturday that private enterprise will create better housing conditions for the Negroes of Hartford. Says "federal housing plans do not permit the erection of dwelling which can be occupied by persons in as low an income group as many Hartford Negroes are in and that private enterprise must come to the rescue" (HC paraphrased quote)

Rev William K Hopes, HHA member, spoke with Northeastern Negro Women's Club convention in Hartford about public housing, right after HHA announced site for future Nelton Court, in Aug 1939: Hartford apartment vacancy rate overall only 10 percent, and "only one percent of that small vacant rental ratio is open to Negroes"  [NOTE: he probably said or meant 2 percent overall vacancy, based on HHA finding in Fall 1939 @MovingDayTradition1940]
Hopes acknowledged that "slums are caused by the people who live in them" and pointed to "high Negro slum incidence on their inability to secure work open to white people of the same economic strata" (paraphrased by HC)
Hopes: "We do not hope or want any racial sebgregation in this USHA homes. The accommodations must go to the neediest first. If poor white people want to move into a new unit that is predominantly colored, let them..."
But Roberta Dunbar, president of Northeastern Federation of Negro Women's Clubs, expressed her fear that "the housing projects will turn into segregation rather than assimilation of the Negroes" (paraphrased HC); "I'm afriad that there will be discrimination against our group" @FederationHearsTalks1939

### Shifting Purpose of Public Housing during War
But as the US prepared to enter World War II, federal government shifted priorities. Needed housing for workers in defense industry in city of Hartford and surrounding areas.

Gov Baldwin and city housing authorities meet to discuss housing shortage in defense industries, June 1940 @GovernorAuthoritiesTalk1940
HHA Guy Larcom: housing authorities will need to "adapt their programs to the changing situation ot help meet the needs of the workers in the factories... housing authorities will probably place emphasis on the housing of workers for a time instead of on slum clearance" (paraphrased by HC) @WarViewedHaving1940
USHA will focus on defense housing "entirely apart from the slum clearance and low-rent housing projects now under way" probably 2500 units for Hartford; city vacancy rate down to 1 percent, also very low in metro region @garfinWarIndustryHousing1940
The possibilty of revamping Hartford's low-rent housing program into a form capable of handling the rush of industrial workers caused by the defense program will be discussed here this week at United States Housing Authority headquarters.
USHA official: "Hartford has available a considerable balance of earmarked funds not yet assigned to specific housing projects. We are wondering if hte Hartford program cannot be redirected so as to provider quarter for industrial workers alled in by the defnse drive... without disrupting Hartford's long-term housing program" @wimerHousingMayBe1940

### Bellevue Square
Original proposal for Bellevue Square promised racially integrated housing in July 1940
Two USHA projects (Nelton Court and Dutch Point) under construction; 3rd project pending in Washington DC and application states: "in the city's worst slum section". "From qualid, unhealthy surroundings, the Negro and the white man should be able to move into some of these newly constructed homes by the end of this year [1940], and before the end of 1941 more than 700 familes should be moving into a more prmising environment" @HousingBodySoon1940

HHA preferences for Nelton Court, Dutch Point, and Bellevue Square: lowest income, and living in injurious housing conditions; have children until 16 years old; resided in Hartford for at least one year; head is citizenship or taken out citizenship papers @RulesListEligibles1940


HHA goes to DC for defense housing funds, since first three projects (Nelton Square and Dutch Point under construction; Bellevue Square very recently announced) focus on low-income housing and slum clearance and "have exhaused all but about 1.25M" of the original $4.5M USHA funding. The anticipated 4th project for 1000 units (to become Charter Oak Terrace, but site not yet announced at this point) will require another $4.5M @MoreHousingAsked1940

Charter Oak Terrace site-to-be announced late Aug 1940: will be close "to Greater Hartford's principal industries such as the Pratt and Whitney Division of Niles, Dement and Pond; Underwood and Royal typewriter factories; the Bush Manufacturing Company; Whitney Chain; Colt's annex; Spencer Turbine; Hartford Electric Steel"
No slum clearance; rents will be higher than low-rent projects @NewHousingProject1940

US plans to build 9100 housing units for defense workers across CT; 5000 units [don't trust this number] to come to East Hartford with $17.5M earmark; Congressman Miller extracted pledge that local zoning laws would be respected; a Greenwich Repub congressmen won assurance that WPA workers would not be used @wimerGovernmentMayBuild1940

**STOPPED reading "hartford housing authority" HC search results in 1 Oct 1940** as Lanham Act is being debated



City leaders created the Hartford Housing Authority, an appointed commission to make decisions....
One of their most influential decisions in the early 1940s was to use federal funds to build four public housing projects, and to racially designate three for White tenants and one for Black tenants.

Nelton Court, Dutch Point, Charter Oak Terrace for White families, and Bellevue Square for Black families



TODO: trace issues with federal and Negro Yearbook data tables with data that conflicts with local story

Hartford leaders made housing decisions that increased racial segregation because tenement neighborhood around Bellevue was comprised of mix of Black and White families, but housing project was designated "for Negroes". In 1940, the specific block where Bellevue Square would be located (Belleveue-Canton-Wooster-Pavilion Streets) was 78 percent Black and 22 percent White households according to census manuscript in 1940-table in otl-public-housing. While these tenement buildings were low-quality housing, neighborhood advocates reported that Black and White families got along with each other [TODO: find 1940-ish news quote]. [TODO: DESCRIBE how in some tenements, the XYZ families lived next door to the ABC families, and provide richer life details.] Most Black families listed their place of birth as CT, GA, NC, SC, while most White families listed theirs as CT, Italy, Russia. This block was typical of the larger area, census tract 9 in 1940, with 75 percent Black residents and 25 percent White residents, according to otl-racial-change map data. But ten years later, the creation of Bellevue Square public housing "for Negroes" shifted this census tract to 92 percent Black and 8 percent White, according to 1950 otl-racial-change.

- These government decisions squeezed Black families into high-density projects, while other projects were lower-density. "At 199 persons per acre, Bellevue Square was, until recently, Hartford most sardine-canned piece of real estate: 501 apartments in 20 buildings on 12.57 acres -- home for 2,500 men, women, and children" @sherwoodStillSitePoor1981; compare with density and/or census tract stats for other projects
- Decisions could have been different: Stetler 1955 report shows variety of racial arrangements, but Hartford opted for Black-only @sherwoodStillSitePoor1981; "This study of racial integration in Connecticut public housing reveals significant findings with respect to racial tenancy, racial occupancy patterns, occupancy pattern rationale, interracial interaction, and interracial attitudes of tenants. The analysis is focused on 72 public housing projects located in the State's principal areas of Negro concentration, i.e., towns having more than 500 Negroes in their population." - page iii
@stetlerRacialIntegrationPublic1955




HHA decides to racially segregate its new public housing projects in late 1940, prior to their scheduled opening one year later.
Public statements shifted over time, but the intent to prevent Black residents from living in selected White-only projects was always clear.

North End Tenants League Will Call Mass Meeting; Opposed to Race Barriers (30 Nov 1940)
A mass meeting will be called by the North End Tenants League, an organization claiming to represent "more than 200 Negro families dwelling in the slum area of the North End of the city," to inquire as to whether Negroes will be barred from the projects of the HHA, specifically Dutch Point, Nelton Court, Bellevue Square
League met at home of James W. King, 188 Bellevue Street; also asks that Rev WK Hopes "Negro representative on the Housing Authority" and others give info
League says "The white and Negro people living in the same area get along very well together" and "to bar the Negro from Nelton Court and Dutch Point would be discriminatory practice" (paraphrased quote by HC)
HHA spokesman says no policy yet for Nelton Court, but "There will probably be no Negroes at the Dutch Point project" (paraphrased HC quote)
Bellevue Square not ready for at least a year but "at least 50 percent of the tenants will probably be Negroes" (HC para quote) @NegroGroupAsks1940

HHA Selects Tenants for Nelton Court (27 Dec 1940)
List of White and Negro Families to Be Notified of Their Acceptance After Final Check
"The Hartford Housing Authority made its first selection of tenants for Nelton Court, a local public housing development of new low rent homes to be opened soon, when at a meeting Thursday it approved a list of white and Negro families submitted as eligible by the Housing Authority's Tenant Selection Staff." [Pending review to ensure income is below limit by law.]
"Only a small number of families were approved by the Authority [for Nelton Court] and most of them were white as the Authority anticipates that Bellevue Square, its largest project upon which the contractor has been authorized to begin work, will house the greatest proportion of the eligible Negro families"
"The Negro families selected [for Nelton] are from
the Belleveu Square block becasue of the need for clearing this site of its bad slum housing to make way for the Authirty's third housing project"
All families within income limits and in bad housing conditions; more description of selection process

But public housing was not evenly located across the growing metropolitan Hartford region.

Racial barriers and public housing
@johnsonPeopleForumAsks1957

Wilber G. Smith, president of the Hartford branch, of the NAACP, brought a plea strengthened with accusations and threats for an end to the "benign" quota to the Hartford Housing Authority Tuesday. @NAACPDemandsCity1965


FROM Coates Reparations: "In 1948, when the Supreme Court ruled that restrictive covenants, while permissible, were not enforceable by judicial action, Chicago had other weapons at the ready. The Illinois state legislature had already given Chicago’s city council the right to approve—and thus to veto—any public housing in the city’s wards. This came in handy in 1949, when a new federal housing act sent millions of tax dollars into Chicago and other cities around the country. Beginning in 1950, site selection for public housing proceeded entirely on the grounds of segregation. By the 1960s, the city had created with its vast housing projects what the historian Arnold R. Hirsch calls a “second ghetto,” one larger than the old Black Belt but just as impermeable. More than 98 percent of all the family public-housing units built in Chicago between 1950 and the mid‑1960s were built in all-black neighborhoods."
