# Update redlining

The word **redlining** recently leaped from the pages of history books into national politics and popular culture.
Word coined....
Over time, historians and journalists---most notably Jackson, Coates, Rothstein, and Hannah-Jones(?)---wrote about redlining in books and articles that began to educate a wider audience. But in 2020, redlining suddenly exploded on mainstream television and the internet. At the Democratic presidential candidate debate, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren challenged former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg's stance and supported her own by releasing a short historical ["What is Redlining?"](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1228009904973238274) video on Twitter, re-shared by over 10,000 subscribers. One year later, comedian John Oliver featured the history of redlining in a [Housing Discrimination episode](https://youtu.be/_-0J49_9lwc) on the satirical news television show, HBO's *Last Week Tonight*, with an additional 7 million views on YouTube. Surprisingly, White folks were now talking about a topic that prior generations had intentionally hidden from public view.^[@warrenWhatRedlining2020; @epsteinWarrenSaysBloomberg2020; @oliverHousingDiscrimination2021. To John Oliver's credit, his show also briefly featured the history of the FHA *Underwriting Manual*, but viewers are more likely to remember those eye-catching HOLC color maps.]

**redlining**: systematic discrimination in offering home mortgages or other financial services based on the social composition of the neighborhood, rather than the individual property or owner.

**Redlining* is a *geographical* form discrimination, where financial institutions avoid making investments--such as home mortgage loans or property insurance--by drawing actual or imaginary "red lines" around entire neighborhoods. When a homebuyer applies for a loan, instead of evaluating the individual's credit or the value of their home, a "redlining" bank would make its decisions based on the racial and socioeconomic composition of the area, often downgrading neighborhoods with Black, immigrant, and working-class families. Most histories of redlining begin during the Great Depression of the 1930s, when the US federal government ...  US federal government's Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC)... began to fund mortgage lending programs to address the housing crisis, some Black newspapers writers began reporting their suspicions of (fill in and confirm Mitchey?). Decades later during the 1960s and '70s, Chicago researchers and community activists popularized the term "redlining" by pointing to..... But both groups based their claims largely on anecdotal evidence of people who were told by lenders that no loans could be made in their neighborhoods. But these were largely anecdotal accounts (?) without the widely-known maps we have today...  @finleyChicagoFreedomMovement2015a; @llinoislegislativeinvestigatingcommissionRedliningDiscriminationResidential1975

Redlining gained more public attention because eye-catching color maps, with direct evidence of racist intent, became more widely accessible.
For example, when Ken Jackson published his famous *Crabgrass Frontier* suburban history in 1985, he resurfaced evidence of 1930s HOLC redlining, but his black-and-white print book only presented an outline sketch of a redlining map for one area, Newark, New Jersey (check), as shown below (image of book cover and page). By the early 2000s, Amy Hillier led a younger generation of historians using digital tools to bring redlining maps out of archives and into living color on computer screens (as shown in image below). Beginning in 2016, Robert Nelson and collaborators published Mapping Inequality, the most extensive digital collection of HOLC redlining maps across the nation...now includes 2xx metropolitan areas, approximately X percent of the estimated 2yy places mapped by HOLC (as shown below).

Hillier's generation of scholars also began to challenge some of Jackson's generalizations about redlining, or how at least how most readers interpreted Jackson's widely-discussed book. All agreed that redlining demonstrated racist **intent** of federal officials and financial lenders, but was its **impact** as strong as many believed? Or did other government-run mortgage programs, such as Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, do more damage than HOLC redlining?
Some historians warn against confusing cause and effect: while HOLC maps *reflected* racist views of their creators, the maps alone did not *cause* discrimination..(wording?)   @gioielliTyrannyMapRethinking2022
Yet... direct evidence of how racist, elitist, and nativist influences in federal housing policies intensified racial and economic segregation in our community.
OR Growing public awareness of the history of redlining has pros and cons. On one hand, more people now see direct evidence of *institutional* housing segregation, countering a prevailing view that racism is driven only by *individual* property owners. On the other hand, increasing views of those eye-catching colorful redlining maps inadvertently fed a common misinterpretation that this HOLC program alone caused housing segregation. (Explain further and unpack "alone" and "caused")

## Federal Lending and Redlining {- #lending}
*by [Shaun McGann and Jack Dougherty](authors.html)*




This chapter compares two US federal programs created during the 1930s Depression---the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA)---to boost the housing market by financially supporting banks and other lenders to offer **mortgages**, long-term loans to make it easier for everyday people to purchase homes.
- Both HOLC and FHA participated in "redlining" by drawing geographic boundaries where the federal government financially supported mortgage lending, and intensified racial and economic segregation that continues today. But of these two federal programs, HOLC attracts more public attention because it produced eye-catching color-coded maps that survived today, while the key FHA documents that still exist are boring-looking underwriting manuals....  
- Both HOLC and FHA instituted ratings systems that downgraded neighborhoods based on the demographics of their residents---such as the presence of Black, immigrant, or impoverished families---rather than assessing value solely on the physical condition of the property.
- Racial and economic segregation in American housing was not simply caused by the prejudices of individual property owners. In addition, segregation was systematically institutionalized by governmental public policies that were designed to make it more affordable for White families to purchase newer homes away from central cities and in the suburbs.


- But as the history of redlining have become popularized, important distinctions about federal programs such as the HOLC and FHA have become blurred, and the latter portion of this chapter draws on scholarship by Amy Hillier, Todd Michney, and LaDale Winling to clear up common misunderstandings. One important lesson: although the HOLC color-coded maps provide the most visually striking portrayal of discrimination in government policy, the more powerful and enduring tools of segregation persisted in the plain white pages of the FHA's bureaucratic *Underwriting Manual*. For this reason, this chapter presents direct evidence from both HOLC and FHA to help us understand key differences in how they divided metropolitan America.

 "The infamous 'security maps' made in the 1930s by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), rating supposed mortgage lending risk in urban neighborhoods across the United States, have long been considered the quintessential expression of racist redlining policy. However, a number of misunderstandings and unwarranted speculations about how these maps were made and used have proliferated. Using previously unexamined correspondence, this article establishes that HOLC could not have used the maps for loan denials, did share them with the Federal Housing Administration but not with private industry, and highly improvised their production with numerous methodological inconsistencies, including with regard to race."

For readers who have not bought a home: You may not yet be familiar with key concepts in personal finance, such as how lower down payments with amortization of principal and interest have made home ownership a more affordable aspect of "The American Dream." See the "[Home and School Shopping Simulation](home-school-shopping.html)" in the Teaching and Researching chapter in this book for a learning activity developed while teaching undergraduate students about housing, to better understand the present-day realities in order to compare with the past.

While government involvement in the private lending market prevented millions of families from being forced out of their homes, and expanded homeownership to millions more, eligibility to participate in these programs was not neutral, and federal funds promoted racial and economic discrimination.^[@freundColoredPropertyState2007] Looking back at these 1930s programs reveals the thoughts and actions of public officials and private real estate interests, who together drew lines that intensified racial and economic segregation in metropolitan Hartford and other regions that continues today.
