Update redlining

RESTART chapter, Jack Dougherty with Shaun (to write in first-person)

## When Redlining History Met Popular Culture

When initially writing this chapter a decade ago, most people were unfamiliar with the term *redlining*. The term means.... systematic denial of financial services (such as home mortgage loans) to entire neighborhoods, not just individuals... Most people had never heard the term or lacked a clear understanding of how it happened in our local communities because evidence was not easily accessible. In the 1980s, scholars such as Ken Jackson resurfaced the largely-hidden role of the US federal government's Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) in redlining cities and suburbs during the 1930s Depression. But Jackson's famous Crabgrass Frontier book featured only a black-and-white sketch of a redlining map for one area, Newark, New Jersey (check), as shown below (image of book cover and page). (insert another descriptive sentence and Jackson quote about general impact) By the early 2000s, a younger generation of historians with digital tools, most notably Amy Hillier, brought redlining maps out of archives and into living color on our computer screens (as shown in image below). Also, Hillier's generation began to challenge some of Jackson's generalizations. All agreed that redlining demonstrated racist intentions of federal officials and financial lenders, but was its impact as strong as many believed? Or did other government-run mortgage programs, such as Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, do more damage than HOLC redlining?

To make sense of these new debates over redlining, in YEAR I went to the US National Archives II building near Washington DC to bring local history back home to Hartford. A long search finally led to a paper X by Y size four-color HOLC maps of Hartford and two suburbs and neighborhood appraisal documents from 1937. Thanks to the National Archives' policy on sharing public document, I carried a portable flatbed scanner and laptop into the reading room, flipped upside down to scan each square over the oversize map on the tabletop. Back in Hartford, each map scan was digitally stitched together to recreate the full-size image (as shown below). No one in Hartford, except the federal field agent and perhaps a small number of mortgage lenders, had ever seen this map, created over 80 years ago.

To make Hartford's redlining history more publicly accessible, I collaborated with Michael Howser and his team from MAGIC, the aptly-named Map and Geographic Information Center at the University of Connecticut Libraries, to create an interactive map with historical documents in YEAR. We published our first edition on the proprietary Google Maps platform, and later shifted to the open-source Leaflet code platform (as shown below). Now anyone with internet access can click on the HOLC's color-coded neighborhoods, to view direct evidence of how racist, elitist, and nativist influences in federal housing policies intensified racial and economic segregation in our community.

Digital historians rapidly expanded public access to redlining maps. By 2016, Robert Nelson and collaborators published Mapping Inequality, the most extensive digital collection of HOLC redlining maps across the nation... In its third edition in 2023, it now includes 2xx metropolitan areas, approximately X percent of the estimated 2yy places mapped by HOLC (as shown below).
(In Connecticut, we now have easy access to HOLC redlining in at least 18 municipalities... and relabel "Bridgeport and Fairfield" to match what you now display. Did your team ever find the map for New London CT? I list it because Amy Hillier 2005 included it in her footnote describing the contents of the NARA collection:
in Connecticut, Bridgeport, Hartford, New Britain, New Haven, New London, Stamford, and Waterbury)

Suddenly the history of redlining crossed over into popular culture.... (list: Coates article in Atlantic magazine, then book cover by Richard, then John Oliver's HBO "Last Week Tonight" episode in YEAR, and buzz on social media sites such as Twitter, as shown in montage below). As a college educator, when your students start hearing about topics on your syllabus from a television comedy-news show and their social media feeds, that signals something has clearly changed in the popular culture.

But increased awareness also means that some commentators now blame HOLC for things this federal program didn’t actually cause. See Allison Shertzer’s thoughtful tweet about John Oliver’s overall pretty-good history of housing discrimination on his HBO show. @allisonshertzerTweetJohnOliver2021

Growing public awareness of the history of redlining has pros and cons. On one hand, more people now see direct evidence of *institutional* housing segregation, countering a prevailing view that racism is driven only by *individual* property owners. On the other hand, increasing views of those eye-catching colorful redlining maps inadvertently fed a common misinterpretation that this HOLC program alone caused housing segregation. (Explain further and unpack "alone" and "caused")

With all of the attention on redlining ... still ask the questions... This chapter (summarize differences between HOLC and FHA; @toddmichneyTweetHOLCFHA2021

"The infamous 'security maps' made in the 1930s by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), rating supposed mortgage lending risk in urban neighborhoods across the United States, have long been considered the quintessential expression of racist redlining policy. However, a number of misunderstandings and unwarranted speculations about how these maps were made and used have proliferated. Using previously unexamined correspondence, this article establishes that HOLC could not have used the maps for loan denials, did share them with the Federal Housing Administration but not with private industry, and highly improvised their production with numerous methodological inconsistencies, including with regard to race."
