# Update redlining

STRENGTHEN topic sentences in body paragraphs by using first claim from intro:
- The first misconception to clear up is that not all HOLC "redlined" neighborhoods were Black neighborhoods. Looking more closely at Hartford and elsewhere, HOLC also applied its lowest-level "red" rating to some lower-income immigrant neighborhoods with no Black residents. However, when we compare Hartford neighborhoods with similar housing and incomes, HOLC lowered its rating if even a very small number of Black residents lived there.

STRENGTHEN topic sentences in body paragraphs by using first claim from intro:
- The second misconception to correct is that while HOLC maps may be more visible to us today, FHA loans did more damage over time by divesting in cities and subsidizing suburbs. While HOLC color-coded maps and neighborhood reports *reflected* racist views in 1930s government policy, FHA *caused* more racial and economic segregation through the plain white pages of its bureaucratic application process and *Underwriting Manual*. Surprisingly, Black Hartford homeowners were *nearly twice as likely* as White homeowners to receive HOLC mortgages relative to their population. In comparison, White homeowners were *nearly twice as likely* as Black homeowners to hold FHA-insured mortgages across the Northeast region, and FHA funded far more homes and lasted decades longer than HOLC.

What about FHA maps?
- HOLC did not invent redlining;  life insurance companies pioneered maps like this, and FHA "began using the exact same method to determine where it would insure mortgages" soon after its creation in 1934; mainstream banks adopted practice @michneyHowWhyHome2024
- "maps were not widely circulated, with access limited to select governmetn circles". Meanwhile,since 1935 FHA "had been producing its own 'Housing Market Analysis Maps,' which unlike HOLC it did use to deny its mortgage insurance guarantees" @michneyHowWhyHome2024
- But both HOLC and FHA fostered interest in mapping and sponsored workshops for appraisers in 1930s "that included racist approaches to valuing and selling real property", appeared on stage at conferences with Philadelphia and Dayton maaps, and administrators "encouraged racist thinking about real estate value" through journal articles that described security maps or showed hypothetical ones @michneyHowWhyHome2024
- Also, HOLC "most certainly used the City Survey maps for discriminatory purposes after completing its 1933-36 'rescue' phase" example of 1943 court case when Black veteran won right to puchase HOLC property in all-White neighborhood, which HOLC policy had prohibited @michneyHowWhyHome2024
- HOLC and FHA were rival agencies and did not officially share public maps between them, until around 1942 when FHA received three sets of HOLC City Survey maps @michneyHowCitySurvey2022 p331-332
- "the new evidence cited here confirms Jackson's original contention that HOLC's maps factored into the FHA's own mapmaking process and quite plausibly that agency's racially-informed denial of access to its mortgage guarantees" @michneyHowCitySurvey2022 p334


## LATER in FHA section
- Did FHA have its own "redlining" maps? While FHA probably inherited HOLC maps when the latter program shut down, or may have created their own racist maps, the archives show no evidence of FHA "redlining" maps for the Hartford region... but some exist for other cities... For Hartford, so far we only know that FHA created (CHECK: Real Property Maps.... which showed.... but not direct evidence of maps used to "redline" Hartford neighborhoods, as the Underwriting Manual achieved that goal.... ) Nevertheless, the larger and more damaging impact of FHA lending, compared to HOLC lending, is undeniable.
- explain how FHA created their own redlining maps, but few of these still exist today, and none for Hartford or CT areas

# FOR CONCLUSION?
Looking back at these 1930s programs reveals the thoughts and actions of public officials and private real estate interests, who together drew lines that intensified racial and economic segregation in metropolitan Hartford and other regions that continues today.
Overall, what matters is that we recognize how the marketplace of private homeownership--and the boundary lines that determined where White or Black families, or wealthy or working-class families could obtain a home -- was fundamentally shaped by public policy. On one hand, federal government involvement in the private lending market prevented millions of families from being forced out of their homes, and expanded homeownership to millions more, from the 1930s Depression through the postwar era. On the other hand, eligibility to participate in these federal lending programs was not neutral, and these policies intensified racial and economic discrimination.^[@freundColoredPropertyState2007]
