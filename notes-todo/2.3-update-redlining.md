Update redlining

RESTART chapter

When we initially wrote this chapter years ago, most people were unfamiliar with the term *redlining*. The term means.... systematic denial of financial services (such as home mortgage loans) to entire neighborhoods, not just individuals... Most people had never heard the term or lacked a clear understanding of how it happened in our local communities because evidence was not easily accessible. In the 1980s, scholars such as Ken Jackson resurfaced the largely-hidden role of the US federal government's Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) in redlining cities and suburbs during the 1930s Depression. But Jackson's famous Crabgrass Frontier book featured only a black-and-white sketch of a redlining map for one area, Newark, New Jersey (check), as shown below (image of book cover and page). (insert another descriptive sentence and Jackson quote about general impact) By the early 2000s, a younger generation of historians with digital tools, most notably Amy Hillier, brought redlining maps out of archives and into living color on our computer screens (as shown in image below). Also, Hillier's generation began to challenge some of Jackson's generalizations. All agreed that redlining demonstrated racist intentions of federal officials and financial lenders, but was its impact as strong as many believed? Or did other government-run mortgage programs, such as Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, do more damage than HOLC redlining?

To make sense of these new debates over redlining, Jack went to Washington DC to bring local history back home to Hartford. In YEAR, he went to the US National Archives II in College Park, Maryland, located the four-color HOLC redlining maps of the Hartford region and neighborhood appraisal documents. Thanks to the National Archives' policy on sharing public document, he brought a flatbed scanner and laptop into the reading room, and flipped it upside down to scan each square of the (size x size) map. Back in Hartford, he digitally stitched together each scan to recreate the 1937 redlining map (as shown below), which hardly anyone in Hartford had ever seen (except for a few bankers), certainly not since it was created 80 years prior.

A few years later in 2010?, with the help of a federal NEH grant, Michael Howser's team at MAGIC, the aptly-named Map and Geographic Information Center at University of Connecticut Libraries, collaborated with Jack to create a digitial interactive version of the Hartford-area redlining map. Now users across the internet can click on color-coded neighborhoods and read the racist reports.... (rethink language here; as shown below, updated version)

Nelson and others created a much larger collection in YEAR

Then redlining hit popular culture.... list... and show montage

With all of the attention on redlining ... still ask the questions... 




Update caption: Based on your updated Redlining site, I will revise this caption to "at least 18" municipalities and relabel "Bridgeport and Fairfield" to match what you now display.
Did your team ever find the map for New London CT? I list it because Amy Hillier 2005 included it in her footnote describing the contents of the NARA collection:
in Connecticut, Bridgeport, Hartford, New Britain, New Haven, New London, Stamford, and Waterbury;

As I describe in this On The Line chapter, public awareness of HOLC “redlining” maps has dramatically increased in mass media in recent years, which is great. But increased awareness also means that some commentators now blame HOLC for things this federal program didn’t actually cause. See Allison Shertzer’s thoughtful tweet about John Oliver’s overall pretty-good history of housing discrimination on his HBO show.

"The infamous 'security maps' made in the 1930s by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), rating supposed mortgage lending risk in urban neighborhoods across the United States, have long been considered the quintessential expression of racist redlining policy. However, a number of misunderstandings and unwarranted speculations about how these maps were made and used have proliferated. Using previously unexamined correspondence, this article establishes that HOLC could not have used the maps for loan denials, did share them with the Federal Housing Administration but not with private industry, and highly improvised their production with numerous methodological inconsistencies, including with regard to race."
