# Update redlining

STRENGTHEN topic sentences in body paragraphs by paraphrasing this intro text:
- The second misconception to correct is that while HOLC maps may be more visible to us today, FHA loans did more damage over time by divesting in cities and subsidizing suburbs. While HOLC color-coded maps and neighborhood reports *reflected* racist views in 1930s government policy, FHA *caused* more racial and economic segregation through the plain white pages of its bureaucratic application process and *Underwriting Manual*. Surprisingly, Black Hartford homeowners were *nearly twice as likely* as White homeowners to receive HOLC mortgages relative to their population. In comparison, White homeowners were *nearly twice as likely* as Black homeowners to hold FHA-insured mortgages across the Northeast region, and FHA funded far more homes and lasted decades longer than HOLC.

What about FHA maps?
- Since no FHA Neighborhood Ratings Map seems to exist for Hartford, we rely on the Underwriting Manual to understand how FHA redlined older mixed-race urban neighborhoods while favoring all-White new suburbs.
- Based on FHA Neighborhood Ratings Maps of existing cities, we know that their four-color risk codes (green, blue, yellow, red) probably mirrored HOLC maps, and most likely matched the A-B-C-D rating levels in the FHA Underwriting Manual   @brownPairHOLCMaps2023
- But FHA also created its Block Analysis Maps to show detailed demographic change across neighborhoods, and a 1939 color-coded version for Hartford survived in the archives. While the color scheme matches rental prices (CHECK), each block of the map also shows eight data points, including the "percent of Negro residents" (CHECK). In this way, historian Lawrence T. Brown argues that "Block Data Maps were fundamentally FHA Negro-tracking maps," to geographically document the rise of "inharmonious racial groups" that the Underwriting Manual warned about and would cause a mortgage application to be rejected.

- footnote: HOLC and FHA were rival agencies and did not officially share public maps between them, until around 1942 when FHA received three sets of HOLC City Survey maps @michneyHowCitySurvey2022 p331-332

# FOR CONCLUSION?
Looking back at these 1930s programs reveals the thoughts and actions of public officials and private real estate interests, who together drew lines that intensified racial and economic segregation in metropolitan Hartford and other regions that continues today.
Overall, what matters is that we recognize how the marketplace of private homeownership--and the boundary lines that determined where White or Black families, or wealthy or working-class families could obtain a home -- was fundamentally shaped by public policy. On one hand, federal government involvement in the private lending market prevented millions of families from being forced out of their homes, and expanded homeownership to millions more, from the 1930s Depression through the postwar era. On the other hand, eligibility to participate in these federal lending programs was not neutral, and these policies intensified racial and economic discrimination.^[@freundColoredPropertyState2007]
