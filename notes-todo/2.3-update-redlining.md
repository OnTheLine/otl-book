As I describe in this On The Line chapter, public awareness of HOLC “redlining” maps has dramatically increased in mass media in recent years, which is great. But increased awareness also means that some commentators now blame HOLC for things this federal program didn’t actually cause. See Allison Shertzer’s thoughtful tweet about John Oliver’s overall pretty-good history of housing discrimination on his HBO show.

"The infamous “security maps” made in the 1930s by the Home Loan Owners’ Corporation (HOLC), rating supposed mortgage lending risk in urban neighborhoods across the United States, have long been considered the quintessential expression of racist redlining policy. However, a number of misunderstandings and unwarranted speculations about how these maps were made and used have proliferated. Using previously unexamined correspondence, this article establishes that HOLC could not have used the maps for loan denials, did share them with the Federal Housing Administration but not with private industry, and highly improvised their production with numerous methodological inconsistencies, including with regard to race."
