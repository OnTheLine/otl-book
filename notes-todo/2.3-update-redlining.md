# Update redlining
## Federal Lending and Redlining {- #lending}
*by [Shaun McGann and Jack Dougherty](authors.html)*

This chapter compares two federal programs---the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (**HOLC**) and the Federal Housing Administration (**FHA**)---to understand how they intensified segregation in metropolitan Hartford over time. Both programs were designed to boost the housing market during the 1930s Depression by funding banks and other lenders to offer long-term mortgage loans that made homeownership more affordable. And to different degrees, both HOLC and FHA engaged in **redlining**, where financial institutions systematically draw "red lines" around specific areas to downgrade or deny investments. Instead of evaluating an individual mortgage applicant and their property, redlining makes discriminatory decisions based on the racial and socioeconomic makeup of the entire neighborhood. In this way, segregation was not driven solely by individual prejudice, but more broadly by institutional and government policies that disinvested in city neighborhoods with Black, immigrant, and working-class families, while favoring funds to build all-White middle-class suburbs.^[Although Black civil rights activists and reporters discovered this form of discrimination and challenged federal leaders on it during the late 1930s, a later generation of researchers and activists coined the term "redlining" during the early 1970s. @michneyNewPerspectivesNew2020; @llinoislegislativeinvestigatingcommissionRedliningDiscriminationResidential1975; @finleyChicagoFreedomMovement2015a]

This chapter argues that FHA policies played a larger role in segregating America, but HOLC has gained more public attention over time because its eye-catching "redlining" maps became more accessible to wider audiences. In 1985, historian Ken Jackson's widely-read *Crabgrass Frontier* book explained how both FHA and HOLC privileged White suburbs, and included a black-and-white outline sketch of a 1937 HOLC map that had been buried away for decades in the US National Archives, as shown in FIG TODO. By the early 2000s, Amy Hillier published articles on both federal programs, but her ["Redlining in Philadelphia" website](https://web.archive.org/web/20040130043548fw_/http://cml.upenn.edu/redlining/HOLC.html) sparked a generation of digital historians by bringing HOLC maps from the archives into living color on computer screens. When journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote his widely-acclaimed "Case for Reparations" essay in 2014, *The Atlantic* magazine featured an [interactive HOLC map of Chicago](https://www.theatlantic.com/media/interactives/2014/06/chicago/holc.html) on its website. Similarly, Richard Rothstein's best-selling 2017 *The Color of Law* book described institutional racism in both the FHA and HOLC, but the front cover of his book highlighted an HOLC map. Around the same time, Robert Nelson and collaborators launched their first edition of [*Mapping Inequality*](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/), the most extensive digital collection of HOLC "redlining" maps in the nation, which has reached millions of viewers now in its third online edition.^[@jacksonCrabgrassFrontierSuburbanization1985; @hillierRedliningPhiladelphia2003, and her earlier print essay @hillierRedliningPhiladelphia2002; @coatesCaseReparations2014; @dintinoHOLCMapExplore2014; @rothsteinColorLawForgotten2017; @nelsonMappingInequalityRedlining2023, first launched in 2016, is currently in its third edition.]

By 2020, HOLC "redlining" maps leaped out of the pages of history and onto the stages of national politics and popular culture. At the Democratic presidential candidate debate, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren challenged former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg's stance on housing and supported her position by releasing a short historical ["What is Redlining?"](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1228009904973238274) video on Twitter, re-shared by over 10,000 subscribers. One year later, comedian John Oliver featured an HOLC redlining map in a [Housing Discrimination episode](https://youtu.be/_-0J49_9lwc) of his satirical news television show, HBO's *Last Week Tonight*, with an additional 7 million views on YouTube. To credit Oliver's research team, he also briefly displayed a scholarly white document to represent the FHA, but his viewers were more likely to remember the color-coded HOLC map.^[@warrenWhatRedlining2020; @epsteinWarrenSaysBloomberg2020; @oliverHousingDiscrimination2021]

RESTART HERE

But as "redlining" spread into popular culture and politics, key differences between the two federal lending programs became blurry. This chapter builds on the works of Amy Hillier, Todd Michney, and LaDale Winling to clear up some common misconceptions.
- Briefly list core ideas here....
- one
- two
- three
these will be explained in the (transition to the) second half of the article about FHA. But first, before explaining HOLC, let's begin with the basics of buying a home, which was very different a century ago....


NOTES FOR LIST (AND MOVE DETAILS INTO LATTER SECTION)


While FHA created its own "redlining" maps, most of those were not archived, and those that still exist are not nearly as colorful.

 One important lesson: although the HOLC color-coded maps provide the most visually striking portrayal of discrimination in government policy, the more powerful and enduring tools of segregation persisted in the plain white pages of the FHA's bureaucratic *Underwriting Manual*. For this reason, this chapter presents direct evidence from both HOLC and FHA to help us understand key differences in how they intensified segregation in metropolitan Hartford.


Hillier's generation of scholars also began to challenge some of Jackson's generalizations about redlining, or how at least how most readers interpreted Jackson's widely-discussed book. All agreed that redlining demonstrated racist **intent** of federal officials and financial lenders, but was its **impact** as strong as many believed? Or did other government-run mortgage programs, such as Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, do more damage than HOLC redlining?
Some historians warn against confusing cause and effect: while HOLC maps *reflected* racist views of their creators, the maps alone did not *cause* discrimination..(wording?)   @gioielliTyrannyMapRethinking2022
Yet... direct evidence of how racist, elitist, and nativist influences in federal housing policies intensified racial and economic segregation in our community.
OR Growing public awareness of the history of redlining has pros and cons. On one hand, more people now see direct evidence of *institutional* housing segregation, countering a prevailing view that racism is driven only by *individual* property owners. On the other hand, increasing views of those eye-catching colorful redlining maps inadvertently fed a common misinterpretation that this HOLC program alone caused housing segregation. (Explain further and unpack "alone" and "caused")



"The infamous 'security maps' made in the 1930s by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), rating supposed mortgage lending risk in urban neighborhoods across the United States, have long been considered the quintessential expression of racist redlining policy. However, a number of misunderstandings and unwarranted speculations about how these maps were made and used have proliferated. Using previously unexamined correspondence, this article establishes that HOLC could not have used the maps for loan denials, did share them with the Federal Housing Administration but not with private industry, and highly improvised their production with numerous methodological inconsistencies, including with regard to race." @michneyHowCitySurvey2022
Notes: Clearing up misconceptions about HOLC maps
1) "many scholars reasonably assumed that their main purose must have been to excludei African American and racial minorities from particiapting in HOLC's mortgage refinancing program. That notion turns out to be incorrect"; nearly 24,000 AfAm homeowners received HOLC assistance, some rates higher than expected, @michneyHowCitySurvey2022 p317
2) "Some observers have struggled to reconcile mounting evidence that HOLC made the majority of its loand in the lowest-rated (C and D) areas - despite Jackson's identification of this counterintuitive pattern early on" @michneyHowCitySurvey2022 p317
3) "similar incredulity has accompanied the revelation that the majority of D areas were not African American neighborhoods" as shown in Mapping Inequality data, only about 36% of D neighborhoods were Black (yet nearly all Black neighborhoods marked as D) @michneyHowCitySurvey2022 p318
For example, HOLC assigned its lowest D-level "red" rating to several Boston neighborhoods which had no Black residents, but had lower-income immigrant residents who received government assistance.  @nelsonRedliningRaceColor2021
4) Some scholars argue that HOLC shows declining significance of race, but age of housing actually shows race as a confounding variable, not independent @michneyHowCitySurvey2022 p318
Overall, as Hillier argued, HOLC did not invent redlining; HOLC City Surveys was NOT highly organized effort to reshape housing market, but more improvised and arbitrary @michneyHowCitySurvey2022 p318
Also: HOLC and FHA were rival agencies and did not officially share public maps between them, until around 1942 when FHA received three sets of HOLC City Survey maps @michneyHowCitySurvey2022 p331-332
"the new evidence cited here confirms Jackson's original contention that HOLC's maps factored into the FHA's own mapmaking process and quite plausibly that agency's racially-informed denial of access to its mortgage guarantees" @michneyHowCitySurvey2022 p334


Seeks to clear up misunderstandings about HOLC maps:
1) HOLC City Survey secruity maps "were not unique"; life insurance companies pioneered maps like this, and FHA "began using the exact same method to determine where it would insure mortgages" soon after its creation in 1934; mainstream banks adopted practice @michneyHowWhyHome2024
2) "perhaps ironically" .."HOLC did not use this particular set of redlining maps to deny anyone access to financing" because City Survey did not begin until Sept 1935 "by which point HOLC had already closed 90 percent of its approximately one million mortgage refinancing loans"... "By the time the first batch of maps was available, in fact, fully 97 percent of the agency's refinancing loans had already been closed" (around June 1935). "This helps explain the fact that HOLC refinanced nearly 24,000 African American homeowners, which might seem counterintuitive but actually maks sense if we understand the program's signfiicance as a givewaway to lenders who had often financed Black borrowers on exploitative terms" @michneyHowWhyHome2024
3) "maps were not widely circulated, with access limited to select governmetn circles". Meanwhile,since 1935 FHA "had been producing its own 'Housing Market Analysis Maps,' which unlike HOLC it did use to deny its mortgage insurance guarantees" @michneyHowWhyHome2024
4) But both HOLC and FHA fostered interest in mapping and sponsored workshops for appraisers in 1930s "that included racist approaches to valuing and selling real property", appeared on stage at conferences with Philadelphia and Dayton maaps, and administrators "encouraged racist thinking about real estate value" through journal articles that described security maps or showed hypothetical ones @michneyHowWhyHome2024
5) Also, HOLC "most certainly used the City Survey maps for discriminatory purposes after completing its 1933-36 'rescue' phase" example of 1943 court case when Black veteran won right to puchase HOLC property in all-White neighborhood, which HOLC policy had prohibited @michneyHowWhyHome2024










For readers who have not bought a home: You may not yet be familiar with key concepts in personal finance, such as how lower down payments with amortization of principal and interest have made home ownership a more affordable aspect of "The American Dream." See the "[Home and School Shopping Simulation](home-school-shopping.html)" in the Teaching and Researching chapter in this book for a learning activity developed while teaching undergraduate students about housing, to better understand the present-day realities in order to compare with the past.

## LATER in FHA section
- explain how FHA created their own redlining maps, but few of these still exist today, and none for Hartford or CT areas
@brownPairHOLCMaps2023

PROBABLY OMIT
While government involvement in the private lending market prevented millions of families from being forced out of their homes, and expanded homeownership to millions more, eligibility to participate in these programs was not neutral, and federal funds promoted racial and economic discrimination.^[@freundColoredPropertyState2007] Looking back at these 1930s programs reveals the thoughts and actions of public officials and private real estate interests, who together drew lines that intensified racial and economic segregation in metropolitan Hartford and other regions that continues today.
