## Suburban public housing for Whites only

REGIONAL housing authority for defense efforts?
The possibility of a fourth housing project for Hartford received "sympathetic" consideration in Washington last week in a series of conferences of housing officials with Berkley Cox, chairman of the Hartford Housing Authority, and Stillman F. Westbrook, former HHA
4th site "would probably be in East Hartford, near the United Aircraft Corporation plant"; HHA cannot function beyond city limits, but Gov Baldwin "recent began a study of the possibility of expanding local [housing] authorities into regional or metropolian units" @4thHousingProject1940

Fed allows suburbs to opt out of public housing
Public Housing: Government Ownership and Management
"For twenty-five years, beginning in 1937, low-rent public housing was the only federal program providing housing assistance to the poor. ..
The first salient characteristic to consider is the identity of the ownership of public housing. For the first twenty-eight years of the program, all federally subsidized housing units were designed, built, and managed with direct over sight by local housing authorities.
The second salient characteristic to consider is the form of the subsidy. For the first thirty-three years of the program, essentially all the capital costs of public housing were borne by the federal government. Conversely, after the construction of public housing, local authorities were required to meet all sub sequent operating expenses out of current rental income.
These two characteristics of the public housing program had far-reaching consequences. Control by local authorities meant that decisions about public housing were responsive to the political processes buffeting small units of government. Local governments, fearful that the availability of public housing would encourage an influx of the poor, could opt to not establish housing authorities, thereby preventing the building of public housing within their borders. The 1949 Housing Act, extending the public housing program originally enacted in 1937, included a requirement that local authorities' applications for funding be approved by local government. Moreover, any locality in which public housing was to be built needed a locally approved "workable program" for community development. this requirement was in force until 1969‚Äù  @quigleyDecentHomeHousing2000 p. 56, cited in @starchmanStruggleMeetHousing2011

Most suburban towns were reluctant to allow the federal government to build public housing inside their municipal boundaries. . . and when this did happen during wartime, local leaders and residents fought the federal rules to keep Af-Ams out. .. . [transition into Oakwood Acres story]

Women working, connecting, and organizing in federal housing
"In those days, this collection of tiny detached homes and trim duplexes was known as Elmwood Acres. Built by the federal government in 1942 on the grounds of a former dairy farm, the neighborhood provided low-rent housing to those who worked in local arms factories. After World War II, the development began welcoming returning veterans, who settled into the houses with their growing families."
..."Elmwood Acres was one of hundreds of government-subsidized communities that sprung up across the nation to house war workers and, later, returning veterans, said Bruce M. Stave, a history professor at the University of Connecticut.
"People then viewed the government as a solution to problems," Stave said. "In recent years, that attitude has changed. The government is looked upon as something that people want to get off their backs."
...Women and husbands both came to find work during war, also made lifelong friendships with neighbors
"The development housed 300 families and was managed by Edna LaRochelle, who became a sort of "den mother" to the neighborhood."
...  The women adopted a more formal name -- The Women's Club of Elmwood Acres -- and a more ambitious agenda. They organized a nursery school, donated gifts to hospital patients and lobbied the town for a traffic light at New Britain Avenue and Mayflower Street."

Suburban resistance to public housing, even when occupied by Whites
... "The newcomers weren't given the warmest welcome by the rest of West Hartford. One man who lived in an abutting neighborhood refused to allow his son to walk through Elmwood Acres on his way to school. "People resented us," LeBourgne said. "They thought the riff-raff was moving in."

### East Hartford wartime public housing

#### Federal response to East Hartford quota against Black residents June 1944 [compare to West Hartford]
"The Boston Regional Office of the Federal Public Housing Authority has "suggested" to the East Hartford Housing Authority that it suspend its "arbitrarily set" quota of Negro admissions to apartments in the East Hartford war housing project and admit a greater number of eligible Negro families to the project, an offocial of the regional office reported Thursday.
"The East Hartford Authoity had 'agreed to the suggestion'... and had promised to increase the number of Negro famiies admitted"
"The practice of setting a quote along racial llines is unauthorized and conflicts with the Federal War Housing Authority's non-discrminatory policies, the official declared. The only requirements for mission to the projects, he noted, were that applicants be in-migrant war workers, or war workers living in substandard conditions"
EHHA Frederick Holland admitted that "numerous apartments at the project are unoccupied, but delcared that the Negro families who had been refused admission were 'ineligible,' not the victims of discrimination"
Boston official stated that agreements with local-regional authorities granted "a certain amount of discretionary power" but perhaps "welll have to do someting about it" [check odd wording here]
Ben Abrahms, sec of Hartford Civic and Economic Welfare Council, welcomed "suggestion" of federal officials: "Colored applicants for federal housing quarters working in East Hartford, who live in substandard conditions, will now, we hope no longer be discrimination against by th eEast Hartford Housing Authority. We have been working on this East Hartford situation for a long time." @RestrictionsHousingBe1944


Mayberry Village project groundbreaking Aug 1941, first Federal Works Agency defense housing project in CT, East Hartford Housing Authority, $2M project to create 500 units
PHOTO of models: 2, 4, and 6-family colonial-style homes @HousingProjectEast1941; @HartfordHousingJob1941
But EHHA not permitted under Lanham Act to manage Mayberry Village due to lack of experience Aug 1941 @HartfordAuthorityOut1941
East Hartford Housing Authority recommended that HHA manage Mayberry Village around Sept 1941
But then East Hartford Housing Authority disappointed that no occupancy plan set up, so voted to recommend that Federal Works Agency manage Mayberry Village with EHHA @CouncilAsksFWA1941
FWA confused by EHHA request and praises HHA @wimerNoRulingControl1941; FWA rejects EHHA plan and keeps HHA as manager @wimerFWARejectsDefense1941
Later in 1942 EHHA takes over mgmt from HHA: At midnight tonight, the Hartford Housing Authority will relinquish the management of Mayberry Village, East Hartford war housing project, and hand it over to the East Hartford Housing Authority.
mgmt was originally taken over by HHA on 1 Feb 1941 because PWA would not permit "inexperienced" housing authority to manage it

## Late Government Intervention on Racism in Public Housing

1949: Gov Bowles asked local housing authorities to "see that no discrimination exists" in govt-sponsored units
"Admission to public housing units in Connecticut must be solely on the basis of need, without regard to race, color or creed"
Reminds all that CT issued formal statement against racial discrimination in state or federal public housing in Spring 1949, and Truman recently issued similar statement on federal housing @BowlesRemindsHousing1949

1951 HHA adopts 10-point program to racially integrate projects, formulated by member Mrs Rosalind Putnam. She pointed to all-White Blue Hills Homes and all-Black Bellevue Square as examples of why restatement of policy is needed
"At this point, Mrs. Ann M. Lee, stenographer for the board, said that minutes of meetings several years ago showed that Bellevue Square was started by the USHA as an all-Negro project. She then told of minutes telling of percentage bases used in assigning tenants at other projects..." [but not quota]
HHA Chair Goodwin Beach: "no recollection of this before"
HHA Comm E. Edward Kaminsky: "What we are being crucified for is what went on in the past. I don't want to take the blame" and denied knowledge of segregation system
Discussion of how current federal forms require "percentage of distribution" by race [but unclear if this means current demographics of area or future assignment of tenants] @HHAAdopts10Point1951
