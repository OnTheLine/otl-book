RETHINK TITLE: How Boundaries Reproduce Inequality

REWRITE to emphasize: Although Americans believe in the power of education to reduce inequality, we have created school district boundaries that reproduce inequality.

	The Hartford region is unlike many other metropolitan areas in other parts of the United States due to the extreme fragmentation of government. Political life in Connecticut today largely consists of one state government and 169 municipalities. In the Hartford region, most public school district boundaries are identical to those of the town or city government. (In rural areas, some towns band together into regional school district, but few of these near urban centers.) These municipal boundaries were mostly carved out along colonial-era settlements. Revisions during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries split some of the larger towns into two or three smaller municipal units.
	As a result, the city of Hartford is less than 18 square miles [check] and its public school enrollment hovers below 24,000 students (about 94 percent minority and low income). In the first ring of suburbs outside of the city, each town operates its own school district boundaries, each with X-Y,000 students.
	By contrast, compare the City of Hartford's public school boundaries to those of Raleigh NC or others in South and West. [Describe what stands out in map below] Countywide school districts like Raleigh cover the equivalent of several Connecticut towns, spreading across XX square miles and enrolling over ZZ,000 students. [Put this here?: How would the history of the Hartford region turned out differently if its political boundaries and school districts were less fragmented?]

Link Dual Map: How do the Hartford region's political boundaries compare to those of other US metropolitan areas?
Design notes: untitled
Design notes: Construct a "comparative" dual-window linked map, which shows two different map locations (in the same time period), but with the same scale and zoom control, to help users visualize relative differences in size and political fragmentation. Our first version will feature Hartford Public Schools in comparison to top-25 enrollment school districts in US. In future, we can modify to include comparable-sized districts, municipal boundaries (rather than school districts), or perhaps some international examples.
PREVIEW: The geographic boundaries of the Hartford Public School district are relatively small when compared to large urban districts in the other parts of the nation, particularly county-wide systems in Southern and Western states. The relative size map viewer, created by MAGIC, will help illustrate these differences by showing side-by-side political boundaries in the same scale.


The result today is that the State of Connecticut is divided up into separate boxes, where for the most part, town lines shape the school district
This pattern holds true for cities and suburbs.
The exception is rural areas of the state, which have formed regional school districts to make learning costs more efficient for lower densities of students per square mile.

SECTION outline
	Since 1950s(?), popular authors have increasingly criticized urban-suburban differences (Conant, Slums and Suburbs, 1961) and disparities (Kozol 1991)
	Income disparities (Average household income); explain that it probably under-reports wealth disparities (home value)
	Educational outcomes (standardized test scores;
	Scatterplot of the two (show also for 6th, 8th, 10th grades as different on/off colors, Tableau Public?)
	Disparities between suburbs - not all suburbs are high-wealth or high-performing
	Why such an unequal relationship? In 1990s, Kozol's Savage Inequalities argued cause was spending difference.
	But that argument makes less sense in Hartford region in 2000s. (show 1945-present historical school spending data)
	Better explanation is that higher-wealth suburban families have drawn lines around themselves with housing and schooling districts, whose children come to school with higher ed level, are less expensive to educate than urban students with greater ed needs

Suburbanization not only meant the movement of people, but more importantly, the migration of wealth out of the city. One of the most interesting measures to track is the most valuable asset owned by the middle-class: their homes.


SECTION OUTLINE
	Hartford does not resemble all other areas (compare Ryan, Five Miles Away vs. Gerald Grant on Raleigh NC)
	In this sense, book makes no claim that Hartford is representative
	But this case study tells us to look at the power of the lines
	Lines are everywhere, but dynamics may be more visible in Hartford region

Hartford's poverty ranking has fluctuated in recent years, due to rising appearance of new cities onto the list. . . \[ Calculate and show better comparative data on poverty rate over time
and on metro region over time\]







When the NY Times published its devastating critique of Hartford poverty, Courant columnist Tom Condon responded that: "We're again the victim of our Colonial-era boundaries, a self- inflicted geographical anomaly. Almost 90 percent of the people in Greater Hartford live outside the city of Hartford, and enjoy good schools, nice neighborhoods, fine recreational opportunities. If Hartford were defined by its metropolitan area, instead of an 18-square-mile inner ring, we wouldn't be one of the poorest cities in the country, we'd be one of the wealthiest. But because we're only counting the inner ring, we keep appearing on "poorest cities" and "troubled cities" lists, for poverty, teen pregnancy or whatever."[^fn1]

Let's imagine: What would Hartford look like if its city boundaries stretched outward into the metropolitan region? Assuming everything else remained the same, how would this change its demographic portrait in census data?

This email focuses on A, so if you want more about B, tell me and I’ll point you in that direction.

Second, there’s a rich literature of scholars, journalists, activists who have written about inequalities along school district boundaries, often between adjacent districts separated by race or wealth.

Three decades ago, everyone was reading this famous activist’s journalistic account of resource and race differences across school district boundaries:

- Jonathan Kozol, Savage Inequalities: Children in America’s Schools (New York: Crown Publishers, 1991).

More recently, scholars, journalists, and activists have written books and created websites that offer a richer analysis of school district divisions:

- James E Ryan, Five Miles Away, A World Apart: One City, Two Schools, and the Story of Educational Opportunity in Modern America (Oxford University Press, USA, 2010), https://books.google.com/books?id=LZqeQbkX8lsC.
