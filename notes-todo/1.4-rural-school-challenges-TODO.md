*Preview of chapter to come*  In contrast to the golden age of urban schools, most rural and suburban schools faced deep challenges to educational quality during the early 1900s. Several had no high schools and relied on regional arrangements with neighboring towns--funded by state subsidies--to educate their teenage students. Decades ago, Connecticut students routinely and legally crossed school district boundaries to receive a public education, and the entire system was arguably more regionalized than it is today, with rigidly divided districts.

In contrast to the golden age of city schools, rural communities and small towns around Hartford struggled to provide a quality public education into the mid-1900s. Decades ago, these outlying districts were deeply challenged to construct adequate facilities for dispersed student populations, particularly as expectations rose for elementary and secondary education. They were relatively weaker than urban schools, by most accounts, and were continually measured against Hartford's higher standard. One factor was the persistence of one-room rural schoolhouses. Although many of these buildings are nostalgically cherished by local historical societies today, they symbolized a backwards approach to modern schooling in the eyes of Connecticut education officials during the 1920s, and the last one did not close until 1970. A second factor was the absence of a high school. Rural towns relied on neighboring districts that operated high schools to rent seats to educate their own students, through state-subsidized tuition and transportation arrangements. So many students legally crossed town boundaries to attend public schools that Connecticut's public education system was (perhaps?) more regionalized decades ago than its rigidly divided districts of today. Looking back, this history questions our present-day thinking that commonly equates "suburban schools" with the "best schools," an idea that is the reverse of what most Hartford-area residents believed less than a century ago.

Today, when residents of the Hartford region search for the "best" public schools, we usually turn our attention away from the city and look toward the suburbs. In particular, we our attentions focus on the elite suburbs, where families who can afford to purchase the most expensive homes effectively purchase the right enroll their children in public schools that generally report the highest test scores and receive the highest academic rankings. Since Connecticut began to administer standardized test scores in the 1980s, and both public agencies and private marketing firms began to rank the so-called "best schools," elite suburbs in this region such as Avon, Farmington, Glastonbury, and Simsbury have routinely topped these lists.[^fn1] No one looks toward Hartford schools that enroll nearly all low-income students in the same way. Sideline: Reading between the lines of so-called "best school" rankings. \[ To come\]

But one-teacher schools were expensive to operate, with relatively low average daily attendance (many under 12 students) and fixed teacher salary costs; Town leaders saw efficiency in consolidation, but replacing them with a modern schoolbuilding was expensive.

By 1930, nearly the entire state had shifted to a town-based system for school governance, of which there were 169 towns; for rural districts that did not have their own high school, the 1909 act permitted towns to "arrange. .  within an adjoining town for the instruction therein" (cited in 259 Collier); meaning that Avon paid tuition for its teenagers to attend high school if desired; consolidation also required more transportation funding, particularly in rural areas; teenage students in Avon rode bus or train to high school in neighboring town, not uncommon (Collier p264-65)


"Avon's educational system is one of the town's greatest financial problems"; enrollment grown and operations costs 5x as much as 10 years ago

High Schools:
in 1911-12, total 15322 students registered in CT high schools
of which 1659 students attended non-local high schools
Towns
55 approved high schools in CT (assume no more than 1 per town)
88 towns pay high school tuition fees, p12
7 towns "did not pay high school tuition or transportation and do not maintain high schools" p13
150 towns subtotal
[State paid nearly $43k in tuition (plus another $16k in conveyance (transportation) for 1659 students to attend non-local high schools, or about $25 tuition per student; yet below it says average $50 tuition; who pays remainder?]
"the number attending non-local high schools is 11 percent of the whole high school registration. Most of these live in small and distinctly rural communities." p13
"To find the unit of population of a successful high school we must go higher than a population of 3,000" for the entire town. "It is difficult to detrmine how much higher or where the high school line should be drawn." p13
"Higher education is relatively more desired in rural than in urban communities" because in cities "[t]here are many outlets and avenues of promotion open to enterprising youth. In the remote and agricultural districts there is little such opportunity. The only opportunity is labor upon the farm, and many boys and girls seek the outlet of education through the schools to other vocations." p13
"A large school, with specialized curriuclum, specialists as teachers, full equipment of laboratories and workshops, will impact a much more efficient secondary education, especially in the various branches of science than can the rural or village school with a secondary department." p14
"Ten years ago the average high school tuition fee was $40, now it is $50 and in many cases $60 to $75." p14
"The point is that the whole rural population interested in secondary education cannot supply through taxes the buildings, equipment, and teachers. . . Where high schools cannot be economically established, secondary education must be provided in non-local schools." p14
Connecticut State Board of Education, Report of the Board of Education (Hartford, Conn., 1913).


 From the perspective of the receiving school, the "tuition-paying pupil" as a "selected" type who, as a rule, "makes a very desirable member of the school." According to Jesse Davis, the supervisor of secondary education for Connecticut in 1924, rural students travelled daily to non-local high schools, averaging about 10 miles away, with a range between 5 and 35 miles. Riding by railroad, trolley, or automobile were the most common forms of transportation. Students who resided outside the town seemed more motivated to attend, with 48 percent graduating, compared to 36 percent for local students. p18 (To be clear, only the most highly motivated non-local students chose to pursue high school outside of their home town, so those numbers are skewed by selection bias.) Most of these non-local high school students did not pursue college, but "enrolled in the commercial curriculum or in  students which will helpm them in earning a living." p19

Ames 1925: "phenomenal growth of public high schools" since 1900; currently 81 four-year secondary schools in state; some are endowed, but free to those in town (lists several); since small towns cannot support high schools, 1921 legislation provides high school opportunity to "ambitious boys and girls in those small towns" to attend school "in an adjoining town, on approval of the local Board of Education or town committee"; p207 Town must pay tutiion and transportation charges, and state reimburses towns with under $4M grand list 2/3 of tuition and 1/3 of transport (with caps) for approved HS. As of June 1924, 2551 pupils from 83 towns attended high schools outside of their town of residence, with state paying $165k total support. "The cost per pupil [is] much higher than the average cost per high school pupil through the State, but the results justify the expense." 208





SIMILAR SENTIMENT IN BLOOMFIELD
BLOOMFIELD 1880s

Bloomfield 1888-89: "For many years the center school has had two departments so that the older or more advanced scholars in the center, and the same class sent from other districts could study the higher branches but the scholars have been sent to schools in Hartford to such an extent that there has been no occasion for this privilege. The practice of sending scholars out of town to school – though entirely justifiable and desirable in many cases —has the effect to diminish the interest in our own schools, especially in the center, where the school will soon become only an ordinary district school…This change has been caused by the railroad accidents and is likely to be permanent. Several of our scholars have been sent to district schools in Hartford while quite young and requiring several years of study in common branches. The parents found the expense burdensome; also became tired of carrying their scholars to the railroad starting coming a period of several years…while it is admitted that the Hartford schools are, in every respect, excellent, there is a tendency among our people to undervalue our own schools. Quite a number of scholars have been prepared for HPHS without having attended the district schools in the city. Their preparation was made in our schools – principally at the center." Bloomfield Town Report, 1888-89, p. 20 @CSL



WETHERSFIELD 1910s
A heated dispute in Wethersfield in 1917, a growing suburb on Hartford's southern border, reflected the tensions over the future direction of the new local high school, the feasibility of teaching of college subjects such as Latin, and a controversy that school board members had sent their own children to be educated in Hartford city schools.
 school board members were sending their own children to be educated [foreshadowing]

1914-15 debate over "the school question" in Wethersfield, and whether or not to build addition to high school
"Because of the crowded condition of the schools, parents are requested by the school committee not to send to school next term beginners under 7 years of age without special permission from the superintendent of schools" [William E Parker, who will be at high school to consult with parents] 19150405HC

But deeper cause seems to be conflicted relationship between principal, state supt, teachers over expectations for the small suburban high school
Principal Harris indirect quote "that the whole trouble was with the superintendent. He said that Mr Parker is in charge of the schools in Portland, Rocky Hill, Griswoldville and Wethersfield." — 19170327HC [probably CT rural education supervisor] HC editorial? refers to "non-resident superintendent" and "resident principal" — 19170329 "Dynamiting Discipline"
Second underlying cause of strike — conflict between principal and "inexperienced" women HS teachers about who would discipline male students— 19170329HC
Parents/students brought petition to school cmte, asking to reinstate principal and request resignations from "the two women teachers, said to be the instigators of trouble between Mr Harris and Supt Parker." — 19170403HC
But sch cmte refused to hire back principal and closed school early for Easter vacation

Wethersfield Parent-Teachers' Association expressed "considerable dissatisfaction with the manner in which the school committee" was running the town schools; --19170411HC
PTA members criticized school cmte for hiring teachers "at the cheapest price" 19170606HC; PTA members demanded more pay for teachers to offer more subjects, and noted that last town meeting, school board "asked an appropriation of $500 less than the previous year," not more. — 19170411HC
PTA president Jordan C Wells complained direct quote: "The committee has been very lax in regards to hiring teachers. When they have a good one that requests an advance in salary, they refuse and let her go." . . . calls for all of the men on the cmte to be replaced; "I want to have the women of the town take this matter up and use their privilege when the time comes."— 19170606HC
PTA had "considerable discussion about the elimination of teaching Latin in the high school," as Supt Parker refused to fund elementary Latin class due to lack of at least 6 eighth graders who intended to go to college; Congregational church pastor Rev George Clark questioned indirectquote "no high school was of much account if Latin was not taught," and should be offered even if only two requested it. Too many students pursuing commercial course instead. Ex-Principal LeRoy Harris indirectly quoted "had been trying all year to have elementary Latin taught, but had been thwarted by Supt Parker, and that only by great kicking was he allowed to teach second year Latin to those pupils who wanted to continue in the study from last year." —19170411HC

His anger was joined by Mrs. John N Welles, former PTA president, who criticized lack of satisfactory pay to retain young teachers who can offer college courses like Latin; direct quote: "I am against state supervision and will say right here that I will use my influence against it. We are in a chaotic condition in this town." If state supervision of local schools was good, observed Albert S. Arnold, "then Hartford and other towns [would] have it, too." (indirect quote); — 19170606HC

PTA pointedly blamed their board of education, particularly members who oversaw local district while taking advantage of educating their own children elsewhere. "It was brought out at the meeting that four members of the school board are sending their children to Hartford schools and have no real interest in Wethersfield schools 'other than to lower the taxes as much as possible'." — 19170411HC
These words were directed at Wethersfield board chair, Frederick A. Griswold, an insurance (agent? -- check directory listing) who lived in Wetherfield, but worked in Hartford (check) and sent his children to be educated in its public schools.

WEST HARTFORD 1920s -- emphasize that the evidence on school quality is very mixed in West Hartford, but this probably reveals greater anxiety than in other towns about whether or not they were actually meeting the city's standards for public schools


 West Hartford most developing suburb in 1900, but weak school quality ; compare with WH early town school history -- 20100210WHL by Tracey Wilson


	Formerly the "Western Division"\[ these paragraphs come from JUH\] of the capital city, West Hartford took on a stronger suburban identity with its residential housing boom in the 1920s. Over 300 building permits for one- and two-family homes were issued in West Hartford in 1922, more than any other municipality in the entire state of Connecticut. Moreover, the total number that year was greater than the previous two years combined.[^fn2] Linked by convenient trolley lines to the corporate headquarters for the nation's leading insurance and banking industries in the adjacent capital city, West Hartford seemed primed to become an ideal destination for the rising middle class. The town was the first in the state to embrace a more modernized form of local government (an elected council with an appointed manager) and adopt a comprehensive zoning plan, and it began to offer local police, fire, and road services that resembled those of the nearby city.[^fn3]
	But what West Hartford lacked, in the eyes of its beholders, was a quality public school system. A somber report, conducted in 1922-23 by the State Department of Education at the request of local school superintendent Lloyd Bugbee, concluded that West Hartford's public school system was mediocre in several respects and did not live up to the town's potential. The fundamental problem was unmanaged growth, as West Hartford had transformed from a nineteenth-century agricultural town into a residential suburban community. The steep increase in home building and population created severely overcrowded schools, run by an administrative system more suitable for a rural township than a modern school district.
	West Hartford had fallen behind on both educational resources and outcomes. State officials judged the current high school building -- which lacked a library, auditorium, and gymnasium -- to be "unsatisfactory from practically every standpoint." Only a tiny fraction of West Hartford's high school graduates entered colleges requiring admissions examinations (2 percent), compared to higher rates in the state overall (5.5 percent) or New England (4 percent).[^fn4] On the elementary level, 3 out of 7 schools enrolled so many pupils that they operated on half-day sessions, which did not fulfill the state's minimum requirement of four hours of instruction per day. On standardized tests, West Hartford elementary student performance did not impress. For example, on the 4th grade arithmetic exam, the district averaged a score of 17, just 1 percentage point (or 8 percent) above the "standard" score of 16.
	Statistically, West Hartford had not failed. But the district had not yet risen up to its potential, according to the survey authors. "There seems no good reason for the West Hartford schools to be satisfied with merely achieving standard results," they wrote. "Their system is potentially above the average." Furthermore, they ventured that the residents of this newly suburbanized district demanded more. "We judge from the nature of the community that superior schools are the desire of the people."[^fn5] Given the sharp increase in new homes, West Hartford enjoyed a larger property tax base and could afford to spend more on its school facilities, if its elected officials exercised the political will to do so. In their present condition in 1923, West Hartford schools were not yet the magnet that eventually would attract residents from the central city. Other "pull factors" such as more affordable and attractive housing were quickly becoming more influential, but not suburban public schools.

 WH school officials, WH chamber of commerce, and State board of education collabored to advocate for building additional schools in growing residential areas of WH in 1923.  Although ed conditions on whole are good, state ed officials urged the construction of new schools, especially in the western region of town where future housing development to grow. WH Supt Bugbee projected slides to show usage of existing room space, poinint out overflow or part-time rooms, and no space for working with “retarded” children who were held behind. Begin new elem planning for upcoming period when new HS will be constructed and elem space opens up. 19230329HC WH
 Striving to claim higher quality schooling in West Hartford
Professor Alfred M. Hitchcock, faculty at HPHS, received headline coverage in 1926 when stating his belief that the WH school system is “about as near the ideal as can be found” in his address on “The College Entrance Examination Board” to parents at Hall High School. In his view, West Hartford parents are “absurd when they comtemplate sending thei children to private schools for scholastic or other advantages,” since the standing of WHPS are comparable or superior.  -- indirect quote from 19260323HC
WH Supt Lloyd Bugbee announces that WH’s elementary school curriculum has “become widely known throughout the United States” and requests for copies received by every state in the union. WH’s detailed course of study for G1-6 English, geography, mathematics was rated by Columbia University as “among the first 35 in more than 9,000 submitted” in 1926. --19270110HC  
Mrs. L.H Bugee, the superintendent’s spouse, led a volunteer women’s committee to develop an exploratory language course for junior high school that textbook publishers described as “so far in advance of existing school systems.” --indicrect quote 19260323HC

Yet the quality of WHPS’ secondary program was heavily debated a year later in 1927, at the first meeting of a parent-teacher assocation meeting at Hall HS. The question focused on whether Hall HS students needed private prep school training to pass college entrance exams. In June 1927, only 43 of 75 students passed the college board exams, though Hall Principal Ray Harriman clarifed that only two pupils were “recommended” for the exams, while the rests were “allowed” to take them.  But his answer was challenged by Mr. Albert Yost, who described the advantages of private schooling received by his son, a student at private Kingswood School in town. “How can a public high school with approximately $125 a year to spend on each pupil compare with a preparatory school which has $600?” Principal Harriman replied by reading list of 5 Hall graduates who recently received scholarships from Yale. Debate over quality continued. ..  [19271020HC Scholastic Standards Discussed]
