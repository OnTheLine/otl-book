TODO: Rethink the entire intro to the Segregating chapter, which formerly included these closing sentences:

...Eventually, as overt racism became harder to defend, Connecticut's white suburbs relied more on exclusionary zoning policies, with "color-blind" rules that required higher-price single-family home construction, effectively blocking lower-wealth families, and by extension, most people of color. As a result, Connecticut's city-suburban barriers trace their legacy to color lines that have faded over time, but remain in force today primarily due to class lines, supported by local and state government.

REFOCUS on how overt racial discrimination shifted over time from overt and written to hidden and verbal

Re-read weaverNegroGhetto1967: ch 12 Hemmed in: more than racial covenants
"the following are the principal instruments used to hem Negroes and other colored minorities into too little space:
- community, enighborhood, and individual opposition to colored neighbors
- race restrictive housing covenants
- agreements, practices, and codes of ethics among real estate boards and operators
- FHA acceptance and perpetuation of real estate practice
- Negro of Negro market by private builders and sources of finance
- Local government's fear that adequate or more housing will encourage Negro migration
- Local political action to restrict Negroes to given areas
- Development of exclusive one-class neighborhoods" p211

There are different ways that property owners and the housing industry have created racial or religious or social class barriers over the past century in Connecticut.

1) Restrictive covenants in property deeds
My co-authors and I describe several race restrictive covenants in 1940s real estate developments in this chapter on West Hartford, and see also this methods chapter on how we found them in the town property records office. See also David Ware’s 2020 essay on similar covenants he found in Manchester. To see the original sources that Dave and my students and I found, click on any colored region in our interactive map that’s also embedded in our book chapter, or click on the PDF folder in our open-source code repo.

2) Restrictive agreements by neighborhood associations
Sometimes people *believe* that a restriction was placed in the property deed, which would be filed in the town property records. Instead, sometimes restrictive agreements were made by a neighborhood association, perhaps written into their by-laws or informally stated, but not filed with town records. Sorry I don’t have a good example to show you at this point.

3) Federal lending and redlining
As my co-author and I describe in this chapter about federal lending and redlining during the 1930s onward, the federal government created different types of racial (and other) barriers in housing programs. Many people have looked at the color-coded HOLC redlining maps that showed overt racial (and ethnic and class) biases by lenders about specific neighborhoods. But no HOLC maps were created for Cheshire. Instead, I believe the more powerful federal restrictions were built into Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, whose guidelines favored all-white newer suburban construction.

4) Racial barriers to public housing
Several CT cities and towns either refused to allow public housing to be built, or blocked Black families from living there (see this chapter , or in cities like Hartford, divided it into White-only and Black-only public housing units during the 1930s-40s-50s.

5) Racial steering by real estate agents
See this chapter about 1970s activism against racial steering in the Hartford area, with links to written testimonies by White/Black/Puerto Rican housing discrimination testers that was used in court against seven of the largest real estate firms at that time. Organizations such as the CT Fair Housing Center continue this type of investigative and legal work today.

6) White-only advertisements for rentals and real estate
I’ve seen some of these in Hartford newspapers during the first half of the 1900s, but they become less common as fair housing laws are strengthened.

7) Exclusionary zoning
I’ve only sketched out some notes for this chapter, but I believe it’s a big part of the story that shapes CT. Rather than using overtly racial barriers (like others above), several CT suburbs began to adopt zoning policies, beginning with West Hartford in 1924, that used property lot size requirements to effectively block lower-income families from residing there, which have disproportionate racial impacts. There’s lots of discussion about this in CT today, such as this CT Mirror “Separated by Design” housing series. For example, if you go to this CT Fair Housing Center zoning page, and scroll down to the “Regulations of Lot Sizes…” section to compare Hartford and Cheshire, you’ll see that Cheshire’s zoning policies allow no more than 2 units of multi-family affordable housing per 1 acre of land, which makes it difficult for developers to economically build it.


HOW DOES THIS FIT IN?
 and legally protected white-only property deeds. After activists overturned these governmental restrictions, the Connecticut real estate industry continued the color line through discriminatory steering and lending, even after the federal Fair Housing Act of 1968 outlawed these practices. Eventually, as overt racism became harder to defend, Connecticut's white suburbs relied more on exclusionary zoning policies, with "color-blind" rules that required higher-price single-family home construction, effectively blocking lower-wealth families, and by extension, most people of color. As a result, Connecticut's city-suburban barriers trace their legacy to color lines that have faded over time, but remain in force today primarily due to class lines, supported by local and state government.
