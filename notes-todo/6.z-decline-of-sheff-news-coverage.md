Some of the best local journalism on Sheff vs O'Neill was published by Jacqueline Rabe Thomas when she was at the CT Mirror, as you'll see in this link to those stories. https://ctmirror.org/?s=%22Sheff+vs.+o%27neill%22&post_date=&post_type=post

But you'll notice that all of Jacqueline's stories were written prior to the pandemic in early 2020. Also, she recently left CT Mirror for CT Public.

Similarly, here's a link to the Hartford Courant coverage of Sheff vs. O'Neill stories (listed in no useful order due to their lousy search engine). Vanessa de la Torre and Matthew Kauffman co-wrote several insightful stories in 2017-18 that questioned many aspects of CT's implementation of school integration. But both of those reporters left the Courant and have not been replaced. https://courant.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Sheff+vs.+ONeill

To my knowledge, this is the most recent substantive Courant article on Sheff, regarding the Jan 2020 settlement agreement:
Josh Kovner, “Milestone Agreement in Sheff vs. O’Neill School Desegregation Case Adds 1,000 Magnet School Seats to Ease Racial Isolation of Hartford Students,” Hartford Courant, January 10, 2020, https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-news-sheff-desegregation-expansion-hartford-magnet-20200110-7hpmkplwxjfxjedqu2r5bic44y-story.html.

Local news coverage of city-suburban school integration, and the Sheff case in particular, has fallen off the radar.
