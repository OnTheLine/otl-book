## Covenants TODO

**WAIT ON THESE HALF-PARAGRAPHS**
For example, in two 2021 publications about the history of segregation in West Hartford, Mayor Shari Cantor recalled that her home on Colony Road "actually had a restrictive covenant and did not allow Jewish people." But when tracing back the paper records, we found no documentation of any restrictive covenant on her property. Yet other residents agree that Jewish homebuyers were excluded from that neighborhood, as surnames listed in late 1950s city directories appear to confirm.^[Shari Cantor recalled anti-Jewish restrictive covenants on her home at 39 Colony Road, West Hartford, in a video oral history for @napervilleheritagesocietyWestHartfordConnecticut2022, and a journalist interview in @puttermanWestHartfordMostly2021. See discussion of Jewish exclusion and 1958 city directory evidence in @wilsonHowSegregationHappened2019.]

**WAIT ON ANOTHER HALF-PARAGRAPH**
A second interpretation is that White homeowners might wish to identify with opponents of segregation rather than its proponents. When Mayor Shari Cantor described her personal experience with housing discrimination to a journalist in 2021, she did so in the context of defending her gradualist approach to affordable housing policy in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. As the journalist wrote: "Shari Cantor, West Hartford’s mayor, says she understands her town’s history of discriminatory housing practices, noting that the house she lives in once held a restrictive covenant. Today, she says, she hopes to create a more inclusive town--- but is wary of any housing policy that might risk residents' property values."^[@puttermanWestHartfordMostly2021]
