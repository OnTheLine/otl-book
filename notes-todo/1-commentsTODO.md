I see THAT towns separated (West Hartford, South Windsor, etc) but it wasn’t clear why or how parish lines became political lines without debate, or why it was done. - Cheryl

The Golden age section: worth commenting on surprisingly high sex ratio of girls to boys? Your very interesting response at the meeting about urban families etc was something I hadn’t thought of. - Cheryl

Same chapter: “wrap our heads around a very different time” – not only is it oddly colloquial, it’s not clear what you mean. Different in what way?

"... the city's poor were far from Asylum Hill. Most lived in slums on the river flats; few would venture to Asylum Avenue in any role other than servants and tradesmen. 'Where are the poor in Hartford?' Twain wrote on his first visit to the city in 1868. 'I confess I do not know. They are 'corralled' doubltless --- corralled in some unsanctified corner of this paradise whither my feet have not yet wandered, I suppose'." p62 
Twain: "This is the center of Connecticut wealth... Hartford dollars have a place in half the greater moneyed enterprises of the Union." p63 @courtneyRichManyWays1999
