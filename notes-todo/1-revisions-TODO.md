REDO chapter intro to describe the 4-5 historical and geographical factors that often surprise new learners about cities and suburbs in Hartford region, compared to elsewhere

- Hartford was the richest city in the nation a century ago... also, rich and poor lived in the same city, but were divided between geographically close neighborhoods
- CT is one state comprised of 169 local town governments, which split into smaller units over time, meaning that policy and politics are fragmented
- Hartford's city school system was considered the best, and nearby tiny rural towns (located in what we now call the suburbs) were recognized as the worst, so state pressured them to consolidate into town-wide units
- But CT retained town borders for schools and many governmental services. Unlike many states to the south and west that established county governments, CT moved in the opposite direction by dissolving its county govt in 1960.... also, annexation happened in many other cities during late 1800s/early 1900s, but Hartford suburbs refused to annex with central city

I see THAT towns separated (West Hartford, South Windsor, etc) but it wasn’t clear why or how parish lines became political lines without debate, or why it was done. - Cheryl

The Golden age section: worth commenting on surprisingly high sex ratio of girls to boys? Your very interesting response at the meeting about urban families etc was something I hadn’t thought of. - Cheryl

Same chapter: “wrap our heads around a very different time” – not only is it oddly colloquial, it’s not clear what you mean. Different in what way? Why is understanding this time relevant to understanding what comes later? That is, is the goal here to get a sense of life back then, or why/how things changed, or … ? - Cheryl

TODO: add to richest
"... the city's poor were far from Asylum Hill. Most lived in slums on the river flats; few would venture to Asylum Avenue in any role other than servants and tradesmen. 'Where are the poor in Hartford?' Twain wrote on his first visit to the city in 1868. 'I confess I do not know. They are 'corralled' doubltless --- corralled in some unsanctified corner of this paradise whither my feet have not yet wandered, I suppose'." p62
Twain: "This is the center of Connecticut wealth... Hartford dollars have a place in half the greater moneyed enterprises of the Union." p63 @courtneyRichManyWays1999
