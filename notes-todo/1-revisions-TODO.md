REDO chapter intro to describe the 4-5 historical and geographical factors that often surprise new learners about cities and suburbs in Hartford region, compared to elsewhere

- Hartford was the richest city in the nation a century ago... also, rich and poor lived in the same city, but were divided between geographically close neighborhoods
- CT is one state comprised of 169 local town governments, which split into smaller units over time, meaning that policy and politics are fragmented
- Hartford's city school system was considered the best, and nearby tiny rural towns (located in what we now call the suburbs) were recognized as the worst, so state pressured them to consolidate into town-wide units
- But CT retained town borders for schools and many governmental services. Unlike many states to the south and west that established county governments, CT moved in the opposite direction by dissolving its county govt in 1960.... also, annexation happened in many other cities during late 1800s/early 1900s, but Hartford suburbs refused to annex with central city

I see THAT towns separated (West Hartford, South Windsor, etc) but it wasn’t clear why or how parish lines became political lines without debate, or why it was done. - Cheryl

The Golden age section: worth commenting on surprisingly high sex ratio of girls to boys? Your very interesting response at the meeting about urban families etc was something I hadn’t thought of. - Cheryl

Same chapter: “wrap our heads around a very different time” – not only is it oddly colloquial, it’s not clear what you mean. Different in what way? Why is understanding this time relevant to understanding what comes later? That is, is the goal here to get a sense of life back then, or why/how things changed, or … ? - Cheryl

TODO: add to richest
"... the city's poor were far from Asylum Hill. Most lived in slums on the river flats; few would venture to Asylum Avenue in any role other than servants and tradesmen. 'Where are the poor in Hartford?' Twain wrote on his first visit to the city in 1868. 'I confess I do not know. They are 'corralled' doubltless --- corralled in some unsanctified corner of this paradise whither my feet have not yet wandered, I suppose'." p62
Twain: "This is the center of Connecticut wealth... Hartford dollars have a place in half the greater moneyed enterprises of the Union." p63 @courtneyRichManyWays1999

Golden era of HPS ed leaders:\[ Find if Burpee uses this phrase\] "Appreciation of the spreading out of the city caused the building of" Weaver HS (1924) and Bulkeley HS (1927), p.837 Burpee ; first Weaver principal William Cross Holden had training in science, law, religion at Univ of Maine; first Bulkeley principal Gustave Feingold had degrees from Trinity and Harvard (including PhD); at same time, HPHS principal Clement Hyde had AB Harvard, honorary degrees from Trinity and Yale, and was "assistant in physics at Harvard and Radcliffe from 1892 to 1924" p838, Burpee 1928;
[if appropriate here] First District school in Hartford: In 1928, there are 23 elem schools in Hartford; the "dean of teachers" in the state is Charles Ames, supervisor of Brown (First District) School; "Twenty-five years ago the most of his pupils were Jewish; today about 90 per cent are Italian." p838; current enrollment about 1,800; "Some of the most distinguished men of the city graduated at this the most central of all the schools." p841, Burpee




STRANDS:
- Instead, Hartford's present-day reputation is one of the poorest cities in the US, with predominantly Black and Latino residents, surrounded by one of the wealthiest metropolitan regions in the nation, where most suburban residents are White.
- outlying rural towns were not the centers of wealth and privilege that we typically identify as the suburbs today. Moreover, rural town schools were widely viewed as steps behind the prestigious city public school system, as described in more detail in a later section. Newcomers to the Hartford region are sometimes astounded to learn about the stark economic and racial disparities.
- When we hear words like city and suburb in our present-day minds, most people associate them with headline phrases of sharp disparity.
- Flip through the news channels or a local paper and these headlines will jump out at you, particularly on schools.
- Headlines and television news programs shout out low test scores. . . .   
- By contrast, suburban school districts, in our present-day minds, exemplify higher status and success.
- People move to outlying suburbs, such as Avon and West Hartford, Connecticut for the “good schools”
- Families often try to move out of city to pursue their dreams in the suburbs, and suburban leaders sometimes defend their homes/schools from outsider they perceive to be unwelcome intruders. This is what we consider “normal” today.

This chapter centers on the intersection of development politics and consumer markets, since both stories -- social structures and individual actions -- shaped metropolitan Hartford. . . . It tells the story of Hartford and three suburbs -- Avon, Bloomfield, and West Hartford -- and how they sharply diverged by competing against one another through development politics (exclusive zoning and school finance) and intensified consumerism (real estate marketing and school rating systems).
In 1900, the rural farming community of Avon began as the least wealthy of the three, but its 1960s-70s economic development strategy (based largely on housing and schools) catapulted it into the most elite suburb in the region. Similarly, West Hartford and Bloomfield competed as early streetcar suburban communities in the 1920s, but their paths diverged sharply in the post-war era as real estate agents actively steered blacks into Bloomfield and whites to West Hartford, where residential zoning and school attendance boundaries also fostered socioeconomic stratification.

One of the last times the Hartford Courant referred to HPHS has one of the best high schools was a 19930110HC sports-page story that quoted some teachers who proud to work there, including former teacher of the year; "not just a 'basketball' school"

HPHS entering class of 1904, lists students by names and schools; includes each subdistrict in Hartford, plus parochial schools, plus "Out of Town and Private Schools" [but no breakdown, and perhaps less than 2% out of town?] -- 19000629HC story; 19000630HC Wethersfield story lists 5 entering HPHS from this town alone
"Hartford Public High School Students Take Good Place" at Yale is subhead; "[T]ake a look at the boys up here for their 'entrance exams' They gatehr here from all over the world, from public and private fitting schools and home tutors, a democratic lot,. . . And to the Hartford citizen comes the gratifying thought that of them all, none will give better account of themselves in all examinations than teh boys from the Hartford Public high School." 19000629HC
