## Zoning by Wealth {- #zoning}

In present-day housing debates, the phrase *exclusionary zoning* refers to local government policies that favor the construction of expensive single-family homes on large tracts of land, rather than more affordable multi-family homes on smaller properties. In other words, exclusionary zoning legally limits who can afford to live in a neighborhood. In Connecticut, the origins of exclusionary zoning can be traced back to one suburban town's attempt to block an urban Jewish grocer from building a store in a residential neighborhood in the early 1920s. While this conflict centered around commercial development, it triggered a new phase in ongoing disputes over who controlled real estate, and the legal tools that property owners and local governments used to separate themselves from people they deemed as undesirable neighbors. Unlike other discriminatory barriers of this era---such as [mortgage redlining](lending.html) and [restrictive covenants](restricting.html)---exclusionary zoning did not directly refer to race, religion, or nationality. Instead, zoning policies cleverly carved up suburban neighborhoods with minimum property-size requirements that segregated residents by access to wealth. In this way, exclusionary zoning became a more sophisticated and so-called color-blind tool of housing discrimination that largely resisted fair-housing legislation of the 1960s-70s civil rights era, and continues to divide Connecticut into the present day.

TODO: Emphasize invisible lines and words above...

When Jacob Solomon Goldberg returned home to Hartford after military service in World War I, he sought to advance himself from a butcher into a businessman. Jacob partnered with his brother Barney and their brother-in-law Hyman M. Cohen to buy a small grocery store in downtown Hartford, near their East Side neighborhood, which they managed together during the early 1920s. Like other entrepreneurs of their era, they "followed the trend of business to the west" and dreamed of opening a second grocery store in the rapidly-growing suburb of West Hartford. The town's population grew at a faster rate than Hartford during the 1910s and nearly doubled in size to almost 9,000 residents. West Hartford town officials granted more than 300 building permits for single- and two-family homes in 1922, more than any other town in Connecticut that year. Linked by convenient trolley lines to the capital city and corporate headquarters for the nation's leading banks and insurance companies, West Hartford was quickly becoming an ideal destination for the rising middle class.^[Jacob Solomon Goldberg (1891-1939) and his wife Anna Miller Goldberg should not be confused with other Hartford residents with similar names. Jacob and his partners purchased and re-named the Guilfoil City Hall Grocery at 42 State Street, Hartford, in 1919. @SecondAnniversaryCity1921; @KingswoodMarketHas1924; @JacobGoldbergObituary1939; @connecticutstateboardofeducationSurveySchoolsWest1923, p. 103.]

Goldberg and his family searched for the perfect location to open a second grocery store. With funds from Jacob's father David, who previously owned a Jewish meat market in Hartford, they bought two valuable parcels of undeveloped land on Farmington Avenue at the corner of Ardmore Avenue, on the trolley line about halfway between the Hartford border and West Hartford's town center. In the early 1920s, only a dozen grocers served all of West Hartford, including several small shops that sold food products out of their homes. Nearby customers typically made frequent purchases during the week due to limited transportation and refrigeration. The closest competitors were located about a half-mile in opposite directions: West Hill Grocery (also on Farmington Avenue, closer to the Hartford border) and M.J. Burnham's (a larger store in West Hartford Center). Although the immediate area around Goldberg's property had only 60 houses in 1923, real estate developers and town officials had subdivided the land into smaller lots, and were building side streets and sewer lines, in anticipation of many more homebuyers. Next door to Goldberg's vacant lots stood the only non-residential building in the vicinity: the West Hartford Armory for the Connecticut National Guard Troop B Cavalry. Perhaps the odor from its horse stables helped explain why no one had yet built a home on Goldberg's empty property lots.^[When David Goldberg died in 1924, his estate valued the property at $40,000, and Jacob and his mother Rachel became its administrators. @DavidGoldbergObituary1924; @DavidGoldbergEstate1924; @ProbateCourtGoldberg1924; @silvermanHartfordJews165919701970, p. 170. West Hill Grocery was located at 765 Farmington Avenue, near the corner of Whiting Lane, and M.J. Burnham's was located at 19 South Main Street in West Hartford Center. @sanbornmapcompanySanbornFireInsurance1923; @GeerHartfordDirectory1923; @rossanoBuiltServeConnecticut2003.]

But when Goldberg applied for a building permit in January 1923, the West Hartford building inspector declined. Instead, the inspector called a public hearing, where "a score of property owners in the Ardmore road section appeared and protested" against Goldberg's plan to build a grocery store. In their eyes, it made no difference that Goldberg had followed every legal requirement in the town building code. It made no difference that his proposed store would be facing the busier Farmington Avenue, or be much smaller than the Armory building next door, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:otl-ardmore-1923). What mattered was that property owners challenged Goldberg's right to build a store in *their* neighborhood, and the town government took their side and refused to grant his building permit. Although Goldberg eventually prevailed and opened his Kingswood Market neighborhood grocery store as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1928-2004-kingswood-hc-whhs), this legal dispute and the anti-Semitic climate surrounding it reveals how exclusionary zoning arose in Connecticut in the 1920s.^[@LegalFightStore1923.

### Anti-Development or Anti-Semitism? {- #anti-semitism}
Why did West Hartford property owners and town officials block Goldberg's building permit? Were they opposed to a grocery story in their residential neighborhood---or to the presence of a Jewish grocer from Hartford? This question defies a simple answer. On one hand, homeowners also opposed related types of commercial real estate development, even when promoted by a local Protestant businessman. On the other hand, opposition to Goldberg's store was more vibrant, and the broader context suggests that anti-Semitic sentiments may have been present, but hidden from public view. We need to consider both types of evidence to fully tell this story.

On the surface, there is no evidence of overt anti-Semitism against Goldberg in this 1923 dispute. No one was recorded to have publicly uttered an anti-Jewish slur against him, nor did he publicly charge that his permit was rejected due to his religion, according to available documents. In fact, the strongest evidence that anti-Semitism was not the primary factor was similar opposition to Fred Kenyon, a local Protestant real estate businessman. One month earlier in December 1922, Kenyon proposed to build a public garage for residents to park their automobiles, to be located in the rear of Lancaster Road, only one block away. But the West Hartford building inspector refused to grant Kenyon a permit due to objections from property owners at a public hearing. Two months later, homeowners on nearby Fern Street went to court to stop Kenyon's real estate company from removing a deed restriction that guaranteed only single-family homes would be built on property in their neighborhood, since they feared that multi-family apartment buildings would lower their property values. Since West Hartford residents and town officials blocked both Goldberg (a Jew) and Kenyon (an Episcopalian), religion was not the sole factor, at least on the surface. ^[No evidence of overt anti-Semitism appears in the newspaper accounts of public meetings, nor in the sparse minutes from town council meetings on the matter. Thanks to local historian Jeff Murray for his research and analysis on Fred Kenyon. @westhartfordTownCouncilMeeting1923; @WestHartfordHas1923; @LandHouseRestriction1923; @FredKenyonDies1937]

But below the surface, the controversy over Goldberg's store arose during a period of intense anti-Semitism and anti-immigration. Across the nation during the 1920s, automaker Henry Ford and broadcaster Father Charles Coughlin widely circulated anti-Jewish conspiracy theories, and US lawmakers imposed immigration quotas to sharply reduce Jewish migrants from Eastern European. In cities like Hartford, Protestant and Catholic leaders at selective institutions of business, medicine, law, and higher education blocked or discouraged Jews from employment or enrollment. In Protestant-led small towns like West Hartford, some local officials and property owners probably perceived Goldberg as a Jewish outsider to their community. Even if no one uttered an anti-Jewish slur against him at a public meeting, to fully understand this controversy we need to examine how several Hartford-area leaders created an anti-Semitic climate and spoke bluntly against Jewish immigrants in their private conversations.^[@highamStrangersLandPatterns2002; @dinnersteinAntisemitismAmerica1995; @bergoffenJewishExperienceAmherst2020]

While growing up in Hartford's Jewish community in the early 1900s, Jacob Goldberg most likely heard the history of how freedom of religion was not originally extended to his people. Early Connecticut began as a Christian colony, with no separation of church and state. After Reverend Thomas Hooker and his followers broke away from the Puritans and settled Connecticut in the 1630s, they established the Congregational Church as the seat of government in each town, and required residents to pay taxes to support its work. Despite the promise of freedom of religion in the First Amendment to the US Constitution in 1789, Connecticut did not officially remove the Congregational Church as the state religion until three decades later. Delegates to Connecticut's Constitutional Convention in 1818 debated the topic of religious freedom, but deliberately voted to extend it only to "every society or denomination of Christians," not other faiths. Jews were not permitted to form their own congregations or worship publicly until 1843, when a delegation of German Jews persuaded the state legislature to grant this right by statute (though the state constitutional language remained overtly Christian until 1965).^[@dalinMakingLifeBuilding1997, pp. 10-13; @cohnCivilRightsJews2010; @hortonConnecticutStateConstitution2011, pp. 11-13; @finlayImportanceBeingPuritan2015; @furerChurchStateLand2018]

When Jacob's parents, David and Rachel Goldberg, migrated to Hartford in 1884, they established one of the city's first kosher meat markets, and helped to settle many of the Eastern European Jews who came after them. Hartford became home to Connecticut's largest Jewish community, with about 11 percent of the city's population estimated to be Jewish in 1920. Most Jewish immigrants lived in crowded tenement buildings in the Front Street and Windsor Street neighborhoods near the Connecticut River, which experts had declared to be "the worst housing conditions in the country" among cities of Hartford's size. To earn a living, Jewish men commonly became peddlers who vocally advertised their goods up and down the streets, and maybe after gaining a foothold, opened a retail storefront. They sometimes came into conflict with Hartford Police over noise complaints in the streets, or doing business on Sundays in violation of Connecticut's Blue Laws to protect the Christian sabbath. By 1912, the Goldbergs earned enough money from their retail business to move out of the crowded East Side and into a single-family home in Hartford's North End. "The poor Jews still lived in the Third Ward" near the Connecticut River, one of Goldberg's contemporaries later recalled, while middle-class Jews were moving into newer housing developments to the west of the city center.^[@silvermanHartfordJews165919701970, p. 170; @GeerHartfordDirectory1912, p. 263; @beckerJewishCommunityHartford1979; @veillerHousingConditionsTenement1903, p. 155; @dalinMakingLifeBuilding1997, ch. 4; @baldwinDomesticatingStreetReform1999, ch. 7. On middle-class and poor Jewish neighborhoods in 1910s-20s, see @klauOralHistoryInterview1974, cited in @huttonBriefLookBack2014, p. 12.]

Jacob followed his father into the retail food business in part because Hartford's Protestant- and Catholic-led institutions blocked Jews of his generation---including several of his relatives---from higher-status positions in other economic sectors. Although Hartford was one of the nation's insurance and banking centers, these institutions only hired a few Jews to serve as bookkeepers or sales agents, and did not allow them to rise into positions of responsibility until the 1950s. According to a survey of 800 officers and directors employed at Hartford's ten largest insurance companies and six largest banks in 1967, only 1 percent were Jewish (and most of them were concentrated in one bank). Both the Protestant-run Hartford Hospital and the Catholic-run St. Francis Hospital barred nearly all Jewish doctors, with rare exceptions, from practicing medicine at their facilities until World War II. These hospital hiring policies were "never written and seldom articulated," but clearly understood. Similarly, Hartford's top three corporate law firms---Robinson and Cole; Day, Berry, and Howard; and Shipman and Goodwin---refused to employ Jews through the 1950s, based on unwritten but widely recognized "gentlemen's agreements" that Jews should not apply, nor would they be considered.^[@silvermanHartfordJews165919701970, p. 86; @lazarusPracticeMedicinePrejudice1991, p. 24; @dalinMakingLifeBuilding1997, pp. 59, 78-82, 174-75; @huttonBriefLookBack2014].

### Uncovering Unwritten Rules Against Jews at Trinity College {-}
Although "unwritten rules" against Jews typically did not appear in public documents, in certain cases we can find them in private documents that their creators believed would remain secret. At Trinity College, Hartford's preeminent institution of higher education, administrative and student leaders strongly expressed anti-Semitic views and implemented strategies to reduce the number of Jewish students from 1915 to at least 1922, according Board of Trustees meeting minutes that were long hidden from public view. For decades, Trinity Board Minutes were guarded as "confidential" and "not available for research use," even by Trinity faculty members like me. Trinity archivist Peter Knapp wrote a book in 2000 that acknowledged the College's anti-Jewish policies and quoted from Board minutes, but these documents were not made publicly available until the Trinity Archives changed its policy in 2017 to release materials after a 50-year period, and began to upload them to the Digital Repository in 2019. Since Trinity's anti-Jewish rules did not appear in any College publications or newspaper accounts from this period, they would have remained invisible today if Trinity's archivists had not made this history public. Furthermore, anti-Semitism at Trinity is noteworthy because the Episcopalians who established the College in 1823 directly challenged the lack of religious tolerance in the Congregationalist Church that dominated state government at that time, and adopted a charter that promised Trinity would "not make the religious tenets of any person a condition of admission."^[@knappTrinityCollegeTwentieth2000, pp. 57-61; @stoykovichAvailabilityTrinityBoard2021. See 1823 College Charter reprinted in @trinitycollegeBulletinCatalogue1919, p. 12.]

Rev. Flavel S. Luther served as President of Trinity College from 1904 to 1919. In public, he was a well-respected mathematician, engineer, and ordained leader in the Episcopalian Church. Hartford voters also elected him to the Connecticut State Senate from 1907 to 1911, where his key accomplishment was to [consolidate rural school districts and solidify town-level governance](consolidating.html). Luther was a Progressive-era Republican who identified with (and bore some resemblance to) former US President Theodore Roosevelt, who accepted his invitation to deliver Trinity's commencement address in 1918. To this day, a Trinity student tradition is to wait until graduation day before stepping on the Luther-Roosevelt commemorative stone on the Long Walk.^[@osbornFlavelSweetenLuther1906; @CommencementPhoto1918; @DrLutherEducator1928; @weaverHistoryTrinityCollege1967, pp. 264-68; @TraditionsLutherRooseveltLong2020]

But behind closed doors, Luther and his contemporaries spoke candidly against Jews. Luther first raised the topic with Trinity's Board of Trustees in 1915, when he warned them about "the problem presented by the slow, but unmistakable, increase of the number of Jews at the College," as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1915-1922-trinity-excerpts). At that time, probably no more than 10 percent of the 250 students on campus were Jewish, most of whom resided in the city of Hartford. "Their presence is resented by the other students and has occasioned many protests by the alumni," Luther observed, and cautioned that "if they increase, the matter may easily become serious." Following the Protestant ideology of prior educators, Luther expressed his conviction that Trinity "should do its share in educating these aliens, whatever their race or religion... [because] it is only by education that they can ever be assimilated and Americanized." Nevertheless, he believed that Jewish student enrollment should be limited in some way because "we cannot afford to sacrifice any of the really higher interests of the college for the sake of a special class." No objections were recorded among the other fourteen board members in attendance, including distinguished clergymen, bankers, judges, and businessmen. No one mentioned that Trinity's founders originally established their college on the principles of religious tolerance.^[18 June 1915 Report by President Luther, read aloud at 21 June 1915 meeting, @trinitycollegeBoardTrusteesMinutes1926, p. 169. Other Board members attending were Rev. Francis Goodwin (Hartford parks architect), Rev. William Vibbert (New York City rector), P. Henry Woodward (Hartford banker), Rev.

Henry Ferguson, Edgar Waterman (Trinity treasurer), Edward B. Hatch (Hartford manufacturer), George D. Howell, Hon. Joseph Buffington (US Circuit Court judge), Robert Thorne, Rev. Samuel Hart (Divinity School dean). The 10 percent Jewish student estimate is based on 23 Jewish students in 1914-15 (p. 277) and a total enrollment of 257 students in 1913-14 (p. 297). @DrLutherEducator1928]

Although some Jewish students were admitted, Trinity leaders refused to accept Black students in this era. During the same closed-door meeting in 1915, President Luther confided to Board members that he had received several applications from "colored boys who wished to enter Trinity College," but reported that he found ways to reject all of them. "In each case so far I have been able to avoid an issue by methods which savor somewhat, I fear, of insincerity; but which have been effective." Perhaps Luther lied to Black applicants about their qualifications, or the finances that would be required, or invented some other reasons why they could not attend Trinity. Looking into the future, he predicted that "the time will come when this matter must be faced and definitely decided." But that day was in the distant future, because Trinity only admitted a few Black students in the 1950s, and did not begin to address racism in its admissions practices until the late 1960s.^[21 June 1915 meeting, @trinitycollegeBoardTrusteesMinutes1926, p. 169. On the small number of Black and Asian students at Trinity prior to the 1920s, see @knappTrinityCollegeTwentieth2000, pp. 337-341.]

Luther accurately predicted that the rising number of Jewish students would soon become a "serious" problem at Trinity College. In April 1918, the Board of Trustees heard from a Student Senate committee, appointed by the faculty "as the result of undergraduate expression of feeling against the Jews." These five Student Senators, two of whom also led the *Trinity Tripod* campus newspaper, claimed that the "alarmingly" high rate of Jewish enrollment was approaching 25 percent (although the actual figure was closer to 15 percent). Student Senators' objections to Jews reflected their negative views of Hartford residents and recent Eastern European immigrants. "The Jews come up to the College from the city, get all they can *from* from the College, and give nothing *to* the College," they wrote. Although Student Senators praised the high scholastic standing of their Jewish peers, they criticized their lack of support for college athletics as well as the war effort. "Speaking in general terms, the Jews have not enlisted in military service while the Gentiles have," they claimed (a false statement, as documents later showed). Furthermore, the Student Senators complained that "most of the Jews at Trinity are Russian," which they believed meant that every classroom "has a Russian socialistic expression of opinion." As a consequence, they told the Board that their classmates "hesitate about showing friends around the College, when they are sure to be greeted frequently by Jews." Board members asked President Luther to address this problem. [Student Senate committee letter, 24 April 1918, by Walter G. Smyth, Harmon T. Barber, Edward M. Hyland Jr., Edward G. Armstrong, and George C. Griffith, read aloud at 27 April 1918 Board meeting, @trinitycollegeBoardTrusteesMinutes1926, pp. 274-75. Smyth and Barber also were leaders of the student newspaper. @TripodElections1918]

President Luther presented more data and observations about Jewish students at the June 1918 Board meeting, He understood Trinity's larger problem was that World War I caused total enrollment to fall from around 250 to only 158 students in 1917-18, when many men left college to enlist in military service or join the workforce. The actual number of Jewish students remained relatively stable at 25 that year, but the proportion of Jews on campus had risen to 15 percent. Drawing on his personal observations of student life, Luther pointed to "a few of the Jews in College who, by reason of exceptional personal qualities, are cordially accepted as good fellows. The other students call them 'White Jews'." Luther's comment revealed how Trinity's dominant White Protestant culture considered most Jews to be *non-White* in this era, and assigned them to a lower position in the racial hierarchy. While Luther described Jews as "good scholars... who pay their bills," he concluded that "they are a definite hindrance to the growth of the College," and suggested ways that Trinity might deter their future enrollment, perhaps by mandatory Christian chapel services.^[President Luther report to Board of Trustees, 28 May 1918, read aloud at Board meeting, 14 June 1918 @trinitycollegeBoardTrusteesMinutes1926, pp. 276-278. On "White Jews," see @brodkinHowJewsBecame1998. Trinity re-instated compulsory chapel services on weekdays and Sundays in January 1919, "unless men are excused to attend church in town," @CompulsoryChapelTrinity1919]

One year later, Trinity student leaders continued to demand that the College reduce Jewish enrollments, but now cloaked their anti-Semitism in more publicly acceptable language of the era. The "Student Movement for Americanization at Trinity" submitted its resolutions to the Board of Trustees in April 1919, and demanded a reduction in "the undesirable element," a coded phrase that replaced direct references to "Jews" or "Hebrews." While Americanization proponents recognized that Trinity's charter promised equality of opportunity regardless of religion, they argued that "90% of the undesirable element lives in Hartford," and that the College needed to discourage local Jews from attending Trinity. They proposed a policy of "compulsory residence" in college dormitories "to influence and Americanize all students which cannot be done to some of the students while living at their homes."[Student Movement for Americanization at Trinity resolutions, presented at 26 April 1919 Board meeting, @trinitycollegeBoardTrusteesMinutes1926, pp. 320-321.]

Trinity leaders embraced this Americanization strategy by enacting an alien-residence policy. To address what some discreetly called "the particularly undesirable element which so seriously lowers the standing of the College," the Board voted to require on-campus dormitory residence for all freshmen and sophomore students "of alien birth, and... whose fathers were of alien birth," effective in Fall 1919. This alien-residence policy was designed to discourage Hartford Jews from attending (since they would have to pay additional residence fees rather than live at home), and to assimilate those who did enroll. The College focused only on students' first two formative years, in part because they lacked sufficient dormitories to mandate it for all students. Board members also discussed whether the alien-residence rule should appear in official College publications, and finally granted President Luther permission to do so. The outcome was a one-page supplement to the 1918-19 Trinity *Catalogue*, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1919-trinity-supplement), published at the end of the academic year in June 1919 so that hardly anyone would actually see it in print. The alien-residence rule did not appear in future editions of the *Catalogue*, nor the *Student Handbook*, nor the *Trinity Tripod* student newspaper, nor the *Hartford Courant* daily newspaper. This cleverly allowed Trinity leaders to hide the policy away from public view, yet still enforce a rule that was "on the books." ^[Report of the Special Committee, presented at 20 June 1919 Board meeting, p. 329-330; Motion voted on at 20 June 1919 Board meeting, p. 333-334; 20 June 1919 Board of Fellows report, p. 335, @trinitycollegeBoardTrusteesMinutes1926; @trinitycollegeSupplementCatalogueTrinity1918; @baldwinShadowIvoryTower2021, pp. 26-27. No mention of the alien-residence policy appeared in the Trinity College *Bulletin (Catalogue)* from 1919 to 1923, the Trinity *Student Handbook* for 1922-1923 (no issues available prior to 1916-17), the *Trinity Tripod* student newspaper for 1919, or the *Hartford Courant* daily newspaper.]

Trinity leaders definitely enforced their alien-residence policy. Officials reported to the Board in October 1919 that the rule was applied to 16 students, but "only three of these cases were Hebrews." This may have signaled that the policy began to meet its goal by deterring some Hartford Jews from applying, and assimilating others who chose to enroll. To avoid burdening non-Jewish immigrants, the Board refined its policy to exempt "students of alien parentage residing in other towns than Hartford" from the dormitory residence requirement, at the discretion of administrators. In other words, the son of a Swedish immigrant in West Hartford could attend Trinity while continuing to live at home, but the son of a Jewish immigrant in Hartford could not.^[Report of the Special Committee, presented at 20 June 1919 Board meeting, p. 329-330; Motion voted on at 20 June 1919 Board meeting, p. 333-334; 20 June 1919 Board of Fellows report, p. 335; 24 October 1919 Report of the Executive Committee to the Board, p. 341, @trinitycollegeBoardTrusteesMinutes1926]

Two years later, new Trinity President Remsen Ogilby asked the Board to grant him greater discretion over the College's alien-residence policy, while continuing to quietly limit the number of Jewish students. In June 1921, Ogilby asked the Board "for a reconsider of the rule requiring sons of foreign born to live on the campus," and noted that the rule "has caused bitter feelings in some quarters." Initially, Ogilby seemed to take a stand against treating Jewish students differently. "If the rule is intended to keep out the members of one single race," he warned, "it is not honest and rules out too many good students who would otherwise be with us." The Board voted to grant him the power to waive the resident rule on a case-by-case basis. Yet one year later, Ogilby reported on Trinity's success in reducing its Jewish population. "The number of Jewish students has been a matter of interest to many of us and has concerned two or three," Ogilby told the Board in 1922, attempting to minimize and put past controversies behind him. He proudly announced that "the percentage of Hebrews in the student body" had declined from 10.5 percent in 1921 to 9 percent in 1922. Interestingly, his presentation did not emphasize that the actual number of Jewish students had remained stable at around 25 (roughly the same number as in 1918), a fact that was disguised because the proportion of Jewish students declined after World War I, when Trinity's total enrollment rebounded to 268 men. Furthermore, Ogilby backed off his initial stance against treating Jewish students differently. In 1922 he presented additional suggestions on "limiting the number of Hebrew students" to the Board's Executive Committee, which they discussed, but took no action, at least on record. Unlike other institutions such as Harvard and Yale, there is no direct evidence that Trinity overtly or covertly invoked an admissions quota to reduce Jewish student enrollment. Instead, Trinity relied on its alien-residence policy to discourage Hartford Jews from attending, and to assimilate those who persisted. Since this rule was hidden from public view, and did not surface again in confidential Board minutes, we do not know when Trinity stopped enforcing it.^[17 June 1921 President Ogilby report to Board, p. 396; 18 June 1941 Board vote, p. 408; 28 October 1922, President Ogilby report to the Board, p. 439; 28 October 1922 Report of the Executive Committee, @trinitycollegeBoardTrusteesMinutes1926, p. 441. For comparisons with Harvard, Yale, and other institutions, see @synnottHalfOpenedDoorDiscrimination2017; @karabelChosenHiddenHistory2005]

To be clear, anti-Semitism among Trinity's Protestant leadership does not prove it was prevalent among West Hartford's Protestant property owners and town officials who objected to Jacob Goldberg's building permit in 1923. But these Trinity College documents demonstrate vibrant anti-Semitism at one of Hartford's most-respected institutions---notably one was founded on the tenets of religious tolerance---and that its leaders were skilled in hiding their anti-Jewish views and actions from the public eye. Further evidence reveals that anti-Semitism was not far beneath the surface in West Hartford. In 1925, Rabbi Abraham Feldman arrived in Hartford to lead Congregation Beth Israel, a Reform synagogue whose members were considering moving to West Hartford, and had purchased land on Farmington Avenue, not far from Goldberg's store. Feldman recalled some of his early, unpleasant encounters with West Hartford town leaders while speaking with an oral historian in 1974. "West Hartford was a closed community politically," Feldman recalled, labeling it "the most Republican town in the US" in the 1920s. Although Jews were just beginning to move from the city to the suburb, "there was no chance for a young Jew, or a Jewish lawyer... who wanted to enter the political life of the community," he remembered, adding that West Hartford's Protestant leaders "didn't want any Catholics, either."^[@MayBuildTemple1924; @feldmanOralHistoryInterview1974, p. 19.]

### Fighting Back {-}
Faced with these anti-Semitic barriers, many Hartford Jews fought back by gathering resources to create their own institutions during this era. Jewish doctors opened Hartford's Mount Sinai Hospital in 1923, and proudly declared that their doors were open "to all citizens regardless of race or creed." Connecticut's only Jewish-led hospital both served the needs of immigrant patients who were viewed as second-class citizens by other hospitals, and created employment opportunities for Jews in medical professions. Jacob's sister, Celia Goldberg Pessin, earned her nursing degree at New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital, and became the first Jewish woman to enter nurses training in Hartford. When Jewish lawyers were refused jobs at Hartford's corporate law firms, some opened their own smaller law offices. Another one of Jacob's sisters, Dora Goldberg Schatz, married attorney Nathan Schatz, who partnered with his brother Louis (a Jewish graduate of Trinity College) to create the Schatz and Schatz law firm in Hartford in 1917. In higher education, Rabbi Feldman also played an instrumental role in the founding of the University of Hartford, open to all students, in 1957.^[Mount Sinai Hospital opening in *Hartford Times* 3 March 1923, cited in @lazarusPracticeMedicinePrejudice1991, p. 36; @chameidesMountSinaiConnecticut2010; @NursingPioneerDies1975; @dalinMakingLifeBuilding1997, pp. 62, 78; @silvermanHartfordJews165919701970, p. 86; @RabbiAbrahamFeldman1967; @RabbiAbrahamFeldman1972; @UniversityHartfordEarly2005]

Jacob Goldberg also fought back. When the West Hartford building inspector refused to grant him a permit to construct his grocery store in January 1923, Goldberg hired an attorney and filed a lawsuit. (Perhaps he received informal advice from his brother-in-law Nathan Schatz, the Jewish attorney who was a rising figure in the Connecticut Republican party.) Goldberg's lawsuit challenged the constitutional authority of the local government to block construction of a building on the arbitrary grounds that "neighbors do not want it." The lawsuit spelled out how Goldberg employed a well-respected local architect, William T. Marchant, who designed the 80 by 60 foot store to conform with all aspects of the West Hartford building code. Furthermore, Marchant's design would be attractive, similar in style to several homes and other buildings he had designed in the area, not an eyesore. Goldberg's lawsuit claimed that West Hartford's building inspector was "exceeding his constitutional rights," even if the town government had delegated him "with such arbitrary powers." This fight over issuing a building permit to a Jewish Hartford grocer grabbed large headlines, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1923-02-07-goldberg-hc), especially when compared to a similar rejection to local Protestant businessman Fred Kenyon two months earlier, which barely made it into the news.^[@LegalFightStore1923; @WilliamMarchantCollection2021; @silvermanHartfordJews165919701970, p. 258. By comparison, the rejection of Fred Kenyon's public garage permit at a December 14, 1922 public hearing was not reported at the time, and appeared near the bottom of a story six months later in @WestHartfordHas1923]

```

Initially, West Hartford leaders fought back against Goldberg. Town Council members voted in March 1923 to task their attorney, and also to retain the services of a second attorney, to defend their building inspector's refusal to grant a permit. Behind the scenes, West Hartford's attorneys realized that Goldberg had a strong case. Without a clearly-defined policy, a court might rule that the Town had refused to grant him a permit for arbitrary reasons, and might reduce the Town's authority to reject other buildings in the future. Perhaps they also discussed the potential risks of bad press over a Protestant-led town government fighting to block a Jewish-owned grocery. In any case, the Town Council eventually relented. At the end of their June 1923 meeting, the Council went into a closed-door executive session, away from the press and the public. They quietly voted to approve Goldberg's building permit, and also created a committee to review local ordinances on building restrictions in residential areas, to ensure they were on stronger legal footing next time. The Council succeeded in keeping the Goldberg controversy out of the headlines, at least temporarily. The following day's news did not mention Goldberg by name, and only hinted at the end of the story that it was "unofficially rumored" that a permit would be granted.^[@DemandEconomyWest1923; @westhartfordTownCouncilMeeting1923, June 5, 1923, p. 210; @WestHartfordTax1923]

For a second time, West Hartford residents spoke out against Goldberg's proposed store. A group of 14 local property owners protested at the next Town Council meeting, and were represented by a spokesperson: real estate businessman M. Martin Kupperstein, who also was one of the few Jewish residents in the neighborhood. Perhaps he was selected to counter any perceptions that their opposition was anti-Semitic. After Kupperstein urged the Council to reverse its decision, the Town Council's attorney informed the protesters that they had examined Goldberg's case "from every possible angle" and decided "it would be a poor policy for the town to attempt to withhold the permit." To put it more simply, another council member stated that the Town would not prevail in court.^[@westhartfordTownCouncilMeeting1923, June 19, 1923, p. 211; @WestHartfordStore1923; @MorrisMartinKupperstein1938. Kupperstein resided at 847 Farmington Avenue, West Hartford, @GeerHartfordDirectory1923, p. 466.]

Who were these West Hartford property owners, and what motivated their protests against Goldberg's grocery store? With the exception of Kupperstein, none of their names appear in official minutes or news accounts of the two public hearings in 1923, nor do we have records of the words they spoke. Furthermore, while the *Hartford Courant* referred to this neighborhood as "one of West Hartford's exclusive residential sections," that description did not match Ardmore Road, where nearly every building was a two-family duplex, in contrast to several other nearby streets with more expensive single-family homes. Perhaps the relative affordability of two-family homes explained why Ardmore Road developed so rapidly, growing from 1 household in 1922 to over 40 households by 1926, according to city directory listings as shown in Table \@ref(tab:1922-26-ardmore-road). Interestingly, the proportion of households with Jewish names rose from 0 out of 13 in 1923 to 8 out of 43 (nearly 20 percent) by 1926, meaning that Ardmore Road also attracted a larger percentage of Jewish residents than probably any other street in West Hartford at that time. Moreover, the Catholic Church purchased a large parcel of land in October 1923 on Farmington Avenue, near the Ardmore Road intersection, where they built St. Thomas the Apostle Church, a structure nearly as large as the nearby Armory. To be clear, we do not know precisely which families lived on Ardmore Road in early 1923, nor could they predict the future, but the Goldberg store controversy may have symbolized that *their* neighborhood was rapidly changing.^[@LegalFightStore1923. Out of 54 buildings on Ardmore Road today, all appear to have been constructed as 2-family units except two addresses: 10 and 14. See Ardmore Road household data from Geer's City Directory listings, 1922-26, and West Hartford Voting Registration Records for Ardmore Road (1920-1926; transcribed by Jeff Murray in 2017 from West Hartford Historical Society archives), both available at https://github.com/OnTheLine/otl-ardmore-road-wh.]

After Jacob Goldberg finally won his building permit, Kingswood Market opened its doors for business in November 1924. He incorporated the business with his brother Barney and two brothers-in-law: attorney Nathan Schatz and Hyman M. Cohen, who managed the market. Jacob Goldberg also moved into the West Hartford neighborhood and purchased a single-family home on nearby Outlook Avenue. Two years later, the Goldberg family sold the business, and a series of owners continued to operate Kingswood Market for decades, until it was unable to compete against a much larger and more modern Whole Foods grocery store that opened four blocks away in 2005. Neighborhood residents mourned when Kingswood Market closed its doors in 2007.^[@KingswoodMarketHas1924; @KingswoodMarketCorporation1924; @CityHallMarket1924; @KingswoodMarket3rd1928; @KingswoodBuildingFarmington1926; @WestHartfordMen1952; @wfsbeyewitnessnewsKingswoodMarketClosing2007; @KingswoodMarketClosing2007. Jacob Goldberg resided at 17 Outlook Avenue in late 1924, @BuildingPermitsWorth1924].

The Town Council concluded this episode by announcing the creation of a new Zoning Commission in July 1923, to find a better way to deal with decisions over what kinds of buildings should be constructed in the future. But zoning was still a new concept, and the council did not yet have a clear idea of how it would work. At that same meeting, the attorney for Fred Kenyon, the local Protestant businessman whose public garage permit also had been rejected, sought to re-open the issue for his client. Since the Town granted a building permit to Goldberg, he argued, shouldn't they also grant a permit to Kenyon? One Council member moved to refer the request to the brand-new Zoning Commission they had created a few minutes earlier, but Kenyon's attorney objected because this entity "had not yet consulted any regulations." The Council agreed with him, but then voted to refer Kenyon's request back to the building inspector who had previously rejected it, which meant it went nowhere.^[@WestHartfordHas1923]

Pressure continued to mount to define what zoning would mean for West Hartford. Simply put, town leaders were searching for a legally defensible policy that would prevent undesirable urban elements from entering *their* rapidly-growing suburb. While West Hartford property owners complained about grocery stores, public garages, and apartment buildings, these types of buildings symbolized their larger fears about Hartford city life---especially its growing population of immigrants in crowded tenements---invading *their* small town. They wanted zoning to protect them and their property values.

### Bringing Zoning from Washington to West Hartford {-}
How did Connecticut's suburban leaders define how zoning would happen in their local communities, both in their words and actions? Like any policy, zoning can be designed to achieve very different goals, positive or negative, depending on whose interests are served. West Hartford leaders collaborated with national experts on a zoning plan that produced more expensive neighborhoods with only single-family homes, protected these homebuyers' property values, and physically distanced them from lower-income residents in multi-family housing and apartment buildings. In the aftermath of the Goldberg grocery store controversy, zoning became a legally defensible strategy that enabled suburbs to exclude most urban neighbors they deemed as undesirable on the basis of wealth, without directly referring to their race, religion, or nationality. West Hartford's history matters because it became Connecticut's first municipality to act on the state's authority to establish local zoning in 1924, and set precedents followed by other suburbs in later decades.

Josiah B. Woods, a West Hartford town councilman, stood out among his peers as the strongest advocate for zoning in the early 1920s, and served as chairman of its zoning commission until 1945. Educated at Amherst College and employed in the business world, he recognized the need for a long-term strategy to manage real estate development in his rapidly growing suburb. While witnessing the heated conflict between Goldberg, property owners, and the building inspector who refused to grant the permit, Woods sought to replace arbitrary decision-making with a town-wide land-use policy that promoted efficient and orderly economic growth. Zoning seemed promising, but the concept was still new across the nation, and relatively unknown in Connecticut. Woods persuaded other members of the town council to create a zoning committee in the fall of 1922, and to appoint him as chair. Months later, his photo appeared prominently in local newspaper coverage that explained how zoning would solve West Hartford's problems, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1923-03-19-wh-woods-hc).^[@WestHartfordHopes1923; @WoodsLeaveWest1945; @WoodsDiesWas1948]

Across the US, as local governments began to adopt zoning laws during the 1910s, state and federal courts were still sorting out what types of restrictions they would permit. Traditionally, US law had been established to defend individual property owners and courts were reluctant to infringe on their rights in the free market. In this context, some cities defended their zoning policies on the grounds that local governments had a responsibility to exert some authority over the real estate market to protect the interests of their residents. For example, New York City's 1916 zoning code separated industrial and residential land for health reasons, and limited the height of skyscrapers to ensure that air and sunlight reached people in smaller buildings nearby. Zoning advocates carefully justified New York City's right to exercise limited "police powers" over land use in order to protect the "public health, safety, order, and general welfare" of its residents. The courts gradually seemed to accept this rationale.^[@whittenBuildingZonePlan1917, p. 334; @wolfZoningAmericaEuclid2008]

But the courts objected to other forms of zoning, such as *race-based zoning* that explicitly separated residents into Black or White neighborhoods. Interestingly, the US Supreme Court's ruling in the 1917 Buchanan v. Warley case overturned race-based zoning, but not on the civil rights grounds that we might expect today. Three years earlier, the city of Louisville, Kentucky approved a zoning law that prohibited Blacks from living in residential blocks that were more than 50 percent White, and vice versa. William Warley, the Black president of the local NAACP chapter, tested the zoning law by purchasing vacant property in a White-majority block from Charles Buchanan, a White real estate agent. Warley cleverly inserted a clause that required him to complete the contract only if the law allowed him to occupy the property as a residence, which the zoning law did not permit. Buchanan went to court to demand his right to sell the property to Warley, and the scenario reversed traditional roles, by forcing the White real estate agent to argue *against* the segregationist housing policy. The US Supreme Court agreed and overturned Louisville's racial zoning on grounds that it interfered with the White agent's constitutional right to sell his property as he pleased---which also happened to protect the Black buyer's right to live in a White-majority neighborhood.^[@buchananv.warleyDecision1917; @powerApartheidBaltimoreStyle1983, pp. 311-313]

To make sense of these zoning laws, Josiah Woods and his West Hartford colleagues sought advice from national leaders. Herbert Hoover, the US Secretary of Commerce (and future US President), led the most activist federal agency of his era by promoting a zoning framework for states and local governments to adopt. The *[Standard Zoning Enabling Act](http://archive.org/details/standardstatezon05bass)* was drafted by New York City attorney and zoning advocate Edward M. Bassett in late 1921, and widely circulated over the next several years by the US Commerce Department. The text offered legally defensible language for state governments to grant zoning authority to local municipalities to achieve multiple objectives. At first, the proposed law introduced zoning in benevolent terms, such as making land-use decisions to reduce street congestion, ensure fire safety, and prevent overcrowding "for the purpose of promoting health, safety, morals, or the general welfare of the community." But the next few lines added that zoning regulations would consider "the character of the district... with a view to conserving the value of buildings." In other words, the federal government's *Standard Zoning Enabling Act* gave legal cover to local municipalities: if they acted under the pretense of public health and community welfare, they could write zoning laws to exclude undesirable types of housing (and their undesirable occupants) in order to raise property values for more desirable homes. Hoover's strategy had success. When his Commerce Department began working on this issue, only 48 US cities and towns had enacted zoning in late 1921, but that number grew to 218 by late 1923.^[@usdepartmentofcommerceStandardStateZoning1924, pp. 4, 6; @knackRealStoryStandard1996]

Josiah Woods latched onto Hoover's language. At the height of the Goldberg controversy in March 1923, he urged other West Hartford town council members to support a bill in the Connecticut state legislature, modeled on the *Standard Zoning Enabling Act*, that would grant decision-making authority specifically to West Hartford and seven other municipalities specifically listed in the bill. Zoning would solve West Hartford's long-term problems, Woods declared, by granting the town the power "to protect the residential character" of designated areas. With backing from the Town Council, Woods testified in favor of the zoning enabling act at the Connecticut legislature, as did New York City zoning advocate Edward Bassett. Their advocacy helped Connecticut's first zoning bill sail through the legislature without controversy, and the governor signed it in June 1923. ^[Josiah Woods must have obtained an early draft of US Commerce Department's *Standard Zoning Enabling Act* by early 1923, because the 1924 edition stated it was first distributed as a mimeograph in August 1922, revised and made public in the same form in January 1923, then printed for wider distribution. @usdepartmentofcommerceStandardStateZoning1924 Indirect quote of Woods on "protect the residential character" in @DemandEconomyWest1923. @usdepartmentofcommerceStandardStateZoning1924; @WestHartfordHopes1923; @ExpertFavorsGeneral1923; @PlansApportionPopulation1923; @BallotProbeBill1923; @connecticutgeneralassemblyPublicAct2791923]

### Designing Zoning to Exclude {-}

Josiah Woods pushed West Hartford to move as quickly as possible to become Connecticut's first municipality to act on its new local zoning powers. With the Goldberg controversy still hanging over their heads, the Town Council quickly appointed a Zoning Commission (chaired by Woods), and allocated funds to hire zoning attorney Edward Bassett to advise them on next steps in the summer of 1923. Bassett cautioned Woods and his colleagues that "all zoning must be constructive and not arbitrary," in order to avoid legal challenges in court. Furthermore, zoning policies affected only future construction in this fast-growing suburb, and would not apply retroactively to existing buildings.^[@ZoningCommissionBe1923; @WestHartfordHas1923; @MoneyWestHartford1923; @ZoningCommissionReady1923]

West Hartford also hired Robert Harvey Whitten, an urban planner who helped Bassett create New York City's zoning code, and also served as a zoning consultant for Cleveland, Ohio; Atlanta, Georgia; and several cities in New England states. In each of these places, Whitten's job was to design the details of a zoning plan and draft them into a public document to persuade local leaders and their constituents to support it. His 1921 *[Cleveland Zone Plan](http://hdl.handle.net/2027/yale.39002044619519)* featured many visual elements, including diagrams of the dangers of mixing residential and commercial buildings, and photographs of apartment buildings intruding on single-family homes, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1921-whitten-cleveland). Whitten's vision of urban planning emphasized homogeneity, with uniform building types in the same neighborhood. Zoning is "like good housekeeping," he quipped. "It provides a place for everything and tries to keep everything in its place."^[@ExpertZoningEngaged1923; @RobertWhittenCity1936; @whittenClevelandZonePlan1921]

 knitr::include_graphics("images/1921-whitten-cleveland.png")
```

Whitten's dream of purely homogenous housing led him to propose zoning for racial separation. Despite the US Supreme Court's 1917 Buchanan v. Warley ruling against this policy, his 1922 *[Atlanta Zone Plan](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Atlanta_Zone_Plan/MmNAAQAAMAAJ)*, published by city officials, directly called for "Race Zoning" to divide residential areas into "white", "colored", and "undetermined" districts. Under Whitten's plan, Black families were not permitted to move into homes in White zones that they did not occupy prior to the passage of the proposed zoning law, and vice versa. "Race zoning is essential in the interest of the public peace, order and security," Whitten wrote, "and will promote the welfare and prosperity of both the white and colored race." Although the Georgia Supreme Court ruled that this plan was unconstitutional, Atlanta's city planners relied on Whitten's race-based zoning maps in future decades. Whether they explicitly called for racial separation (as Whitten did in the South), or discreetly avoided any direct mention of race, religion, or nationality (as Whitten did in the North), urban planners of the 1920s commonly used zoning as a tool for social separation.^[@whittenAtlantaZonePlan1922, p. 10; @silverRacialOriginsZoning1997; @rothsteinColorLawForgotten2017, pp. 46-53]

Whitten crafted the 1924 *[West Hartford Zoning](https://www.google.com/books/edition/West_Hartford_Zoning/bdKsAAAAMAAJ)* report to blend the soft rhetoric of inclusion with hard rules of exclusion. The introduction promised that zoning would bring "orderliness" and "efficiency" to the town's rapid growth, with "an increase of health, comfort and happiness for all people." It recognized that the suburb's primary function was to provide housing for people who worked in the adjacent city of Hartford and to serve "all classes and all grades of economic ability," including "factory workers, office employees, and the various business and professional groups." But deep inside the report, Whitten designed a system to economically segregate residents into homogenous neighborhoods with rules that dictated home prices. The plan divided West Hartford's residential areas into five sections---A, B, C, D, and E---based on the minimum amount of land per family that the new law required to build housing, as shown in Table \@ref(tab:1924-zone). The most exclusive A zones were designated for upper-income single-family homes because they required at least 9,000 square feet of land (1/5 of an acre) per family. At the opposite end were the C, D, and E zones, set aside for more affordable multi-family duplexes, triples, and apartments, where the rules required significantly less land per family. Additional guidelines increased the amount of land needed to build in more exclusive areas: A-zone homes could occupy no more than 30 percent of the property lot, and also must be 60 feet wide on the street-facing side in order to spread them further apart. While these 1920s rules may seem modest by today's standards (where many Connecticut suburbs now require more than 1 acre of land for a single-family home), Whitten recommended *nearly twice* the amount of land per family in West Hartford's most exclusive zone compared to similar zones in Cleveland and Atlanta.^[@whittenWestHartfordZoning1924, pp. 1, 2, 10, 13. Whitten recommended a minimum of 5,000 square feet of land per family in A-1 zones in Cleveland and Atlanta, @whittenClevelandZonePlan1921, p. 12; @whittenAtlantaZonePlan1922, p. 13.

Overall, West Hartford's 1924 zoning formula relied on minimum-land rules to create separate neighborhoods for expensive single-family homes versus affordable multi-family homes, and to physically distance these residents from each other. Whitten's report bluntly stated its objectives. Zoning made it "uneconomic to build two-family houses" in A and B areas because real estate developers needed to buy *twice* as much land compared to the amount needed for a single-family home, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1924-whitten-highlight-10). Given the same land costs, developers would generate more profits by building and selling two single-family homes, rather than one two-family home. While "three-family houses and apartments houses are not prohibited in the A, B, or C area districts," Whitten clarified, his zoning laws would influence the marketplace by removing incentives to build mixed-income housing. The new rules rewarded developers who built exclusionary neighborhoods.^[@whittenWestHartfordZoning1924, p. 10.]


(ref:1924-whitten-highlight-10) Whitten's zoning plan for West Hartford demonstrated how local governments could create minimum-land rules that made it "uneconomic" for private real estate developers to build multi-family housing in areas designated for single-family homes, thereby creating powerful incentives for exclusion.

To be clear, Whitten's zoning plan did not exclude all multi-family housing from West Hartford. But the plan pushed lower-income families into lower-rated C, D, and E areas---the only zones where duplexes, triples, and apartments could economically be constructed---which made it more difficult to find affordable housing in the suburb. Overall, exclusionary zoning was designed to reduce the amount of multi-family housing that developers would have built. Whitten's 1924 report cautioned readers about multi-family housing taking over suburban space that, in his view, should be reserved for single-family homes. It featured photographs with captions warning that "large apartment houses are spreading farther west along Farmington Avenue and into side streets," taken in the same area as the Goldberg grocery store controversy the prior year. Although the zoning plan did not prohibit apartment houses, the minimum-land rules and related guidelines ensured that "crowded tenement house conditions [that] exist in many larger communities," such as the city of Hartford, "will be effectively prevented in West Hartford."^[@whittenWestHartfordZoning1924, pp. 10, 12, 16, 17]

(ref:1924-whitten-apartments-p17-16) Robert Whitten's 1924 *West Hartford Zoning* report warned about the dangers of apartment buildings "spreading farther west" from the city into the suburb where, in his view, single-family homes belonged.

Josiah Woods and his colleagues embraced Whitten's zoning plan for West Hartford. As the Zoning Commission chairman, Woods wrote the foreword to the published report, which called attention to the need for an "orderly" plan for developing the suburb's "large unbuilt areas" in the near future. After public discussions and some minor adjustments, the Town Council voted to approve nearly all of their consultant's recommendations in March 1924, and became Connecticut's first municipality to enact local zoning ordinances, only nine months after the state enabling act. New York City zoning attorney Edward Bassett sent his compliments to West Hartford on their fast adoption of Whitten's recommendations. The Connecticut Chamber of Commerce brought Bassett back the following year, to advise more towns that sought to be granted the same zoning powers as West Hartford. Bassett persuaded them to drop their individual petitions for zoning, which he argued would be found unconstitutional, and instead to support a state-wide comprehensive bill that he assured them would "stand the tests of the court." Local leaders followed Bassett's advice, and Connecticut passed its second enabling act in 1925, a more comprehensive bill that expanded zoning power to nearly all 169 municipalities across the state.^[@whittenWestHartfordZoning1924, p. 1; @FramingZoningSystem1924; @ZoningPlanWest1924. See seven minor adjustments listed in @ZoningCommissionPlan1924; @VoteSupportZoning1925; Connecticut's 1925 zoning act specifically exempted the city of New Haven. @connecticutgeneralassemblyPublicAct2421925]

Bassett's prediction was correct. In 1926, the US Supreme Court voted 6-3 in the Euclid v. Ambler case to uphold local government's right to zoning, based on this test case where a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio created residential zones that blocked a landowner from selling their property for industrial use. This landmark ruling represented a major shift in the interpretation of US law. In the 1917 Buchanan case, the Court ruled against racial zoning on the grounds that local government infringed on individual rights to sell property to whomever they chose. But less than a decade later in the Euclid case, the court's majority agreed that local governments *could* limit individual rights to property as long as they "find their justification... for the public welfare." Zoning laws are constitutional unless they are "clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare" of the community. This language precisely matched the state zoning enabling bill text that Bassett, Hoover, and other zoning advocates recommended. Also, while the Euclid case on industrial versus residential zoning did not require the Court to rule on the exclusionary minimum-land regulations that towns like West Hartford had implemented, the Court made its views on multi-family housing very clear: "very often the apartment house is a mere parasite, constructed in order to take advantage of the open spaces and attractive surroundings" created by single-family homes, which are threatened by the growth of multi-family homes.^[@euclidv.amblerDecision1926; @freundColoredPropertyState2007, pp. 81-87; @rothsteinColorLawForgotten2017, pp. 52-53]

The US Supreme Court's ruling in Euclid emboldened local governments to enact more exclusionary zoning. Back in West Hartford, the fast-changing real estate market led some developers to test the boundaries by buying sufficient land to meet the minimum requirements to build 6-family and 12-family apartments in A and B zones, which Whitten intended for single-family homes. The Town Council responded with more restrictive zoning in 1927, and voted for an outright ban against apartment buildings in A and B areas, regardless of the amount of land per family. Once again, local government protected single-family housing and prevented multi-family housing, with little justification on how its laws served the general welfare of the community.^[@12FamilyApartmentWay1926; @ApartmentsBannedAreas1927]

As local governmental power to implement exclusionary zoning grew during the next few decades, the soft rhetoric of public health and community welfare steadily slipped away. We can see the changes most clearly in the words spoken by Josiah Woods, who served on West Hartford's zoning commission from its origins until 1945???

Originally, Woods defended zoning on the grounds that it protected "residential character..."

Back in the 1920s... Josiah

SECTION CONCLUSION
Josiah B. Woods served on West Hartford's zoning policy boards, in one capacity or another, from its origins in the early 1920s to its maturity in the early 1940s..... --- zoning defined in suburbia as a system to protect property values by defending single-family homes from urban intrusions.... The soft rhetoric of general health and welfare had dropped away...   WOODS........ Looking back from 1940s: Zoning for preserving property values -- Zoning should be thought of in the light of protecting existing property values, Josiah B. Woods, veteran chairman of the Town Plan and Zoning Commission declared in a statement Sunday in which he said that personal antagonism to regulation hits been aroused in many cases and gives reasons why there should be no resentment in the future. WH zoing comm underlying policy is "to make West Hartford a suburban town 'for real homes'."
Direct quote of Woods on 20th anniversary of WH regarding "personal antagonism to regulations": "It is wise to go back to the fundamentals of zoning. The town is given the authority to make zones for the preservation of existing values... Zoning exists to protect those values...If this is fully understood, there should be no antagonism of any kind."
Recent amendment to zoning regs would give Zoning Board complete authority over all uses of buildings in residential zones except those exclusively used as dwellings, and Town Council turned it back to Comm one week ago. @ProtectionPropertyValues1944

Drafting local ordinances this way made zoning an exclusionary tool to restrict neighborhoods by wealth, and most likely to pump up high-end real estate sales. Unlike other tools developed around the same time (such as racially restrictive property covenants that prohibited non-white residents, and have since been outlawed by civil rights legislation), wealth-based zoning remains perfectly legal today. But it does nothing to promote the health and safety of the citizenry, as promised by the original intent of the state law.

Avon and adjacent town zoning comparison 1954 @avonPresentZoningFact1954

dominant size of min plot/family

Avon (East) = 87000 (2 acre)

Avon (West) = 30000

Farmington (West) = 20000

Farmington (Northeast) = 40000

West Hartford (east of Mt Road = 10,000 (AA)

Bloomfield (west) = 30000 (R30)

Simsbury = 25000

Canton = no zoning regs

 shows present zoning for Avon (amended Oct 19, 1951, and Fall 1953) and comparisons for adjacent towns:

Bloomfield, adopted March 15, 1950

Simsbury, adopted Nov 21, 1952

West Hartford, amended to Dec 3, 1951

Farmington, adopted April 27, 1950


TODO -- reconstruct sources for Case Study: Avon (analysis of Professor Anika Singh Lemar, Yale Law School) in @boggsYourFairShare2020

1948  15,000 sq ft minimum parcel

1951 rezoned area west of Farmington River to min 2 acre parcels

1953 rezoned area east of Farmington River to min 30,000 sq ft

1957 rezoned portions of eastern area to min 40,000 sq ft; anticipates possibility of apartments by conditional permit

by 1967 vast majority of Avon is zoned for 1 acre and 2 acre lots; discrete areas zoned for commercial and industrial

Why did zoning not happen earlier in these towns?
- zoning infringed on individual rights of residents to use property as they wish, a core principle in rural comm.
- but as rural towns experienced rapid real estate development, they adopted suburban governments that traded individual rights for group protection against threats of urban life, such as apartment buildings with lower-income outsiders to their community

Why did zoning matter?
- zoning is built into the environment; once zoned for single-family homes, and those are built out, hard to make change
- zoning by local government inherently protects the interests of current residents, not interests of the metro region or the state in providing affordable housing opportunities for all residents...
