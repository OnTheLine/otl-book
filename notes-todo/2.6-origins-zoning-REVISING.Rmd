## Origins of Exclusionary Zoning {- #origins-zoning}
In present-day housing debates, the phrase *exclusionary zoning* refers to local government policies that favor the construction of expensive single-family homes on large tracts of land, rather than more affordable multi-family homes on smaller properties. In other words, exclusionary zoning legally limits who can afford to live in a neighborhood. In Connecticut, the origins of exclusionary zoning can be traced back to one suburban town's attempt to block an urban Jewish grocer from building a store in a residential neighborhood in the early 1920s. While this conflict centered around commercial development, it triggered a new phase in ongoing disputes over who controlled real estate, and the legal tools that property owners and local governments used to separate themselves from people they deemed as undesirable neighbors. Unlike other discriminatory barriers of this era---such as [mortgage redlining](lending.html) and [restrictive covenants](restricting.html)---exclusionary zoning did not directly refer to race or religion. Instead, zoning policies cleverly carved up suburban neighborhoods with minimum home-size and property-size requirements that segregated residents by access to wealth. In this way, exclusionary zoning became a more sophisticated and so-called color-blind tool of housing discrimination that largely resisted fair-housing legislation of the 1960s-70s civil rights era, and continues to divide Connecticut into the present day.

When Jacob Solomon Goldberg returned home to Hartford after military service in World War I, he sought to advance himself from a butcher into a businessman. Jacob partnered with his brother Barney and their brother-in-law Hyman M. Cohen to buy a small grocery store in downtown Hartford, near their East Side neighborhood, which they managed together during the early 1920s. Like other entrepreneurs of their era, they "followed the trend of business to the west" and dreamed of opening a second grocery store in the rapidly-growing suburb of West Hartford. The town's population grew at a faster rate than Hartford during the 1910s and nearly doubled in size to almost 9,000 residents. West Hartford town officials granted more than 300 building permits for single- and two-family homes in 1922, more than any other town in Connecticut that year. Linked by convenient trolley lines to the capital city and corporate headquarters for the nation's leading banks and insurance companies, West Hartford was quickly becoming an ideal destination for the rising middle class.^[Jacob Solomon Goldberg (1891-1939) and his wife Anna Miller Goldberg should not be confused with other Hartford residents with similar names. Jacob and his partners purchased and re-named the Guilfoil City Hall Grocery at 42 State Street, Hartford, in 1919. @SecondAnniversaryCity1921; @KingswoodMarketHas1924; @JacobGoldbergObituary1939; @connecticutstateboardofeducationSurveySchoolsWest1923, p. 103.]

Goldberg and his family searched for the perfect location to open a second grocery store. With funds from Jacob's father David, who previously owned a Jewish meat market in Hartford, they bought two valuable parcels of undeveloped land on Farmington Avenue at the corner of Ardmore Avenue, on the trolley line about halfway between the Hartford border and West Hartford's town center. In the early 1920s, only a dozen grocers served all of West Hartford, including several small shops that sold food products out of their homes. Nearby customers typically made frequent purchases during the week due to limited transportation and refrigeration. The closest competitors were located about a half-mile in opposite directions: West Hill Grocery (also on Farmington Avenue, closer to the Hartford border) and M.J. Burnham's (a larger store in West Hartford Center). Although the immediate area around Goldberg's property had only 60 houses in 1923, real estate developers and town officials had subdivided the land into smaller lots, and were building side streets and sewer lines, in anticipation of many more homebuyers. Next door to Goldberg's vacant lots stood the only non-residential building in the vicinity: the West Hartford Armory for the Connecticut National Guard Troop B Cavalry. Perhaps the odor from its horse stables helped explain why no one had yet built a home on Goldberg's empty property lots.^[When David Goldberg died in 1924, his estate valued the property at $40,000, and Jacob and his mother Rachel became its administrators. @DavidGoldbergObituary1924; @DavidGoldbergEstate1924; @ProbateCourtGoldberg1924; @silvermanHartfordJews165919701970, p. 170. West Hill Grocery was located at 765 Farmington Avenue, near the corner of Whiting Lane, and M.J. Burnham's was located at 19 South Main Street in West Hartford Center. @sanbornmapcompanySanbornFireInsurance1923; @GeerHartfordDirectory1923; @rossanoBuiltServeConnecticut2003.]

But when Goldberg applied for a building permit in January 1923, the West Hartford building inspector declined. Instead, the inspector called a public hearing, where "a score of property owners in the Ardmore road section appeared and protested" against Goldberg's plan to build a grocery store. In their eyes, it made no difference that Goldberg had followed every legal requirement in the town building code. It made no difference that his proposed store would be facing the busier Farmington Avenue, or be much smaller than the Armory building next door, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:otl-ardmore-1923). What mattered was that property owners challenged Goldberg's right to build a store in *their* neighborhood, and the town government took their side and refused to grant his building permit. Although Goldberg eventually prevailed and opened his Kingswood Market neighborhood grocery store as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1928-2004-kingswood-hc-whhs), this legal dispute and the anti-Semitic climate surrounding it reveals how exclusionary zoning arose in Connecticut in the 1920s.^[@LegalFightStore1923.

### Anti-Development or Anti-Semitism? {- #anti-semitism}
Why did West Hartford property owners and town officials block Goldberg's building permit? Were they opposed to a grocery story in their residential neighborhood---or to the presence of a Jewish grocer from Hartford? This question defies a simple answer. On one hand, homeowners also opposed related types of commercial real estate development, even when promoted by a local Protestant businessman. On the other hand, opposition to Goldberg's store was more vibrant, and the broader context suggests that anti-Semitic sentiments may have been present, but hidden from public view. We need to consider both types of evidence to fully tell this story.

On the surface, there is no evidence of overt anti-Semitism against Goldberg in this 1923 dispute. No one was recorded to have publicly uttered an anti-Jewish slur against him, nor did he publicly charge that his permit was rejected due to his religion, according to available documents. In fact, the strongest evidence that anti-Semitism was not the primary factor was similar opposition to Fred Kenyon, a local Protestant real estate businessman. One month earlier in December 1922, Kenyon proposed to build a public garage for residents to park their automobiles, to be located in the rear of Lancaster Road, only one block away. But the West Hartford building inspector refused to grant Kenyon a permit due to objections from property owners at a public hearing. Two months later, homeowners on nearby Fern Street went to court to stop Kenyon's real estate company from removing a deed restriction that guaranteed only single-family homes would be built on property in their neighborhood, since they feared that multi-family apartment buildings would lower their property values. Since West Hartford residents and town officials blocked both Goldberg (a Jew) and Kenyon (an Episcopalian), religion was not the sole factor, at least on the surface. ^[No evidence of overt anti-Semitism appears in the newspaper accounts of public meetings, nor in the sparse minutes from town council meetings on the matter. Thanks to local historian Jeff Murray for his research and analysis on Fred Kenyon. @westhartfordTownCouncilMeeting1923; @WestHartfordHas1923; @LandHouseRestriction1923; @FredKenyonDies1937]

But below the surface, the controversy over Goldberg's store arose during a period of intense anti-Semitism and anti-immigration. Across the nation during the 1920s, automaker Henry Ford and broadcaster Father Charles Coughlin widely circulated anti-Jewish conspiracy theories, and US lawmakers imposed immigration quotas to sharply reduce Jewish migrants from Eastern European. In cities like Hartford, Protestant and Catholic leaders at selective institutions of business, medicine, law, and higher education blocked or discouraged Jews from employment or enrollment. In Protestant-led small towns like West Hartford, some local officials and property owners probably perceived Goldberg as a Jewish outsider to their community. Even if no one uttered an anti-Jewish slur against him at a public meeting, to fully understand this controversy we need to examine how several Hartford-area leaders created an anti-Semitic climate and spoke bluntly against Jewish immigrants in their private conversations.^[@highamStrangersLandPatterns2002; @dinnersteinAntisemitismAmerica1995; @bergoffenJewishExperienceAmherst2020]

While growing up in Hartford's Jewish community in the early 1900s, Jacob Goldberg most likely heard the history of how freedom of religion was not originally extended to his people. Early Connecticut began as a Christian colony, with no separation of church and state. After Reverend Thomas Hooker and his followers broke away from the Puritans and settled Connecticut in the 1630s, they established the Congregational Church as the seat of government in each town, and required residents to pay taxes to support its work. Despite the promise of freedom of religion in the First Amendment to the US Constitution in 1789, Connecticut did not officially remove the Congregational Church as the state religion until three decades later. Delegates to Connecticut's Constitutional Convention in 1818 debated the topic of religious freedom, but deliberately voted to extend it only to "every society or denomination of Christians," not other faiths. Jews were not permitted to form their own congregations or worship publicly until 1843, when a delegation of German Jews persuaded the state legislature to grant this right by statute (though the state constitutional language remained overtly Christian until 1965).^[@dalinMakingLifeBuilding1997, pp. 10-13; @cohnCivilRightsJews2010; @hortonConnecticutStateConstitution2011, pp. 11-13; @finlayImportanceBeingPuritan2015; @furerChurchStateLand2018]

When Jacob's parents, David and Rachel Goldberg, migrated to Hartford in 1884, they established one of the city's first kosher meat markets, and helped to settle many of the Eastern European Jews who came after them. Hartford became home to Connecticut's largest Jewish community, with about 11 percent of the city's population estimated to be Jewish in 1920. Most Jewish immigrants lived in crowded tenement buildings in the Front Street and Windsor Street neighborhoods near the Connecticut River, which experts had declared to be "the worst housing conditions in the country" among cities of Hartford's size. To earn a living, Jewish men commonly became peddlers who vocally advertised their goods up and down the streets, and maybe after gaining a foothold, opened a retail storefront. They sometimes came into conflict with Hartford Police over noise complaints in the streets, or doing business on Sundays in violation of Connecticut's Blue Laws to protect the Christian sabbath. By 1912, the Goldbergs earned enough money from their retail business to move out of the crowded East Side and into a single-family home in Hartford's North End. "The poor Jews still lived in the Third Ward" near the Connecticut River, one of Goldberg's contemporaries later recalled, while middle-class Jews were moving into newer housing developments to the west of the city center.^[@silvermanHartfordJews165919701970, p. 170; @GeerHartfordDirectory1912, p. 263; @beckerJewishCommunityHartford1979; @veillerHousingConditionsTenement1903, p. 155; @dalinMakingLifeBuilding1997, ch. 4; @baldwinDomesticatingStreetReform1999, ch. 7. On middle-class and poor Jewish neighborhoods in 1910s-20s, see @klauOralHistoryInterview1974, cited in @huttonBriefLookBack2014, p. 12.]

Jacob followed his father into the retail food business in part because Hartford's Protestant- and Catholic-led institutions blocked Jews of his generation---including several of his relatives---from higher-status positions in other economic sectors. Although Hartford was one of the nation's insurance and banking centers, these institutions only hired a few Jews to serve as bookkeepers or sales agents, and did not allow them to rise into positions of responsibility until the 1950s. According to a survey of 800 officers and directors employed at Hartford's ten largest insurance companies and six largest banks in 1967, only 1 percent were Jewish (and most of them were concentrated in one bank). Both the Protestant-run Hartford Hospital and the Catholic-run St. Francis Hospital barred nearly all Jewish doctors, with rare exceptions, from practicing medicine at their facilities until World War II. These hospital hiring policies were "never written and seldom articulated," but clearly understood. Similarly, Hartford's top three corporate law firms---Robinson and Cole; Day, Berry, and Howard; and Shipman and Goodwin---refused to employ Jews through the 1950s, based on unwritten but widely recognized "gentlemen's agreements" that Jews should not apply, nor would they be considered.^[@silvermanHartfordJews165919701970, p. 86; @lazarusPracticeMedicinePrejudice1991, p. 24; @dalinMakingLifeBuilding1997, pp. 59, 78-82, 174-75; @huttonBriefLookBack2014].

### Uncovering Unwritten Rules Against Jews at Trinity College {-}
Although "unwritten rules" against Jews typically did not appear in public documents, in certain cases we can find them in private documents that their creators believed would remain secret. At Trinity College, Hartford's preeminent institution of higher education, administrative and student leaders strongly expressed anti-Semitic views and implemented strategies to reduce the number of Jewish students from 1915 to at least 1922, according Board of Trustees meeting minutes that were long hidden from public view. For decades, Trinity Board Minutes were guarded as "confidential" and "not available for research use," even by Trinity faculty members like me. Trinity archivist Peter Knapp wrote a book in 2000 that acknowledged the College's anti-Jewish policies and quoted from Board minutes, but these documents were not made publicly available until the Trinity Archives changed its policy in 2017 to release materials after a 50-year period, and began to upload them to the Digital Repository in 2019. Since Trinity's anti-Jewish rules did not appear in any College publications or newspaper accounts from this period, they would have remained invisible today if Trinity's archivists had not made this history public. Furthermore, anti-Semitism at Trinity is noteworthy because the Episcopalians who established the College in 1823 directly challenged the lack of religious tolerance in the Congregationalist Church that dominated state government at that time, and adopted a charter that promised Trinity would "not make the religious tenets of any person a condition of admission."^[@knappTrinityCollegeTwentieth2000, pp. 57-61; @stoykovichAvailabilityTrinityBoard2021. See 1823 College Charter reprinted in @trinitycollegeBulletinCatalogue1919, p. 12.]

Rev. Flavel S. Luther served as President of Trinity College from 1904 to 1919. In public, he was a well-respected mathematician, engineer, and ordained leader in the Episcopalian Church. Hartford voters also elected him to the Connecticut State Senate from 1907 to 1911, where his key accomplishment was to [consolidate rural school districts and solidify town-level governance](consolidating.html). Luther was a Progressive-era Republican who identified with (and bore some resemblance to) former US President Theodore Roosevelt, who accepted his invitation to deliver Trinity's commencement address in 1918. To this day, a Trinity student tradition is to wait until graduation day before stepping on the Luther-Roosevelt commemorative stone on the Long Walk.^[@osbornFlavelSweetenLuther1906; @CommencementPhoto1918; @DrLutherEducator1928; @weaverHistoryTrinityCollege1967, pp. 264-68; @TraditionsLutherRooseveltLong2020]

But behind closed doors, Luther and his contemporaries spoke candidly against Jews. Luther first raised the topic with Trinity's Board of Trustees in 1915, when he warned them about "the problem presented by the slow, but unmistakable, increase of the number of Jews at the College," as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1915-1922-trinity-excerpts). At that time, probably no more than 10 percent of the 250 students on campus were Jewish, most of whom resided in the city of Hartford. "Their presence is resented by the other students and has occasioned many protests by the alumni," Luther observed, and cautioned that "if they increase, the matter may easily become serious." Following the Protestant ideology of prior educators, Luther expressed his conviction that Trinity "should do its share in educating these aliens, whatever their race or religion... [because] it is only by education that they can ever be assimilated and Americanized." Nevertheless, he believed that Jewish student enrollment should be limited in some way because "we cannot afford to sacrifice any of the really higher interests of the college for the sake of a special class." No objections were recorded among the other fourteen board members in attendance, including distinguished clergymen, bankers, judges, and businessmen. No one mentioned that Trinity's founders originally established their college on the principles of religious tolerance.^[18 June 1915 Report by President Luther, read aloud at 21 June 1915 meeting, @trinitycollegeBoardTrusteesMinutes1926, p. 169. Other Board members attending were Rev. Francis Goodwin (Hartford parks architect), Rev. William Vibbert (New York City rector), P. Henry Woodward (Hartford banker), Rev.

Henry Ferguson, Edgar Waterman (Trinity treasurer), Edward B. Hatch (Hartford manufacturer), George D. Howell, Hon. Joseph Buffington (US Circuit Court judge), Robert Thorne, Rev. Samuel Hart (Divinity School dean). The 10 percent Jewish student estimate is based on 23 Jewish students in 1914-15 (p. 277) and a total enrollment of 257 students in 1913-14 (p. 297). @DrLutherEducator1928]

Although some Jewish students were admitted, Trinity leaders refused to accept Black students in this era. During the same closed-door meeting in 1915, President Luther confided to Board members that he had received several applications from "colored boys who wished to enter Trinity College," but reported that he found ways to reject all of them. "In each case so far I have been able to avoid an issue by methods which savor somewhat, I fear, of insincerity; but which have been effective." Perhaps Luther lied to Black applicants about their qualifications, or the finances that would be required, or invented some other reasons why they could not attend Trinity. Looking into the future, he predicted that "the time will come when this matter must be faced and definitely decided." But that day was in the distant future, because Trinity only admitted a few Black students in the 1950s, and did not begin to address racism in its admissions practices until the late 1960s.^[21 June 1915 meeting, @trinitycollegeBoardTrusteesMinutes1926, p. 169. On the small number of Black and Asian students at Trinity prior to the 1920s, see @knappTrinityCollegeTwentieth2000, pp. 337-341.]

Luther accurately predicted that the rising number of Jewish students would soon become a "serious" problem at Trinity College. In April 1918, the Board of Trustees heard from a Student Senate committee, appointed by the faculty "as the result of undergraduate expression of feeling against the Jews." These five Student Senators, two of whom also led the *Trinity Tripod* campus newspaper, claimed that the "alarmingly" high rate of Jewish enrollment was approaching 25 percent (although the actual figure was closer to 15 percent). Student Senators' objections to Jews reflected their negative views of Hartford residents and recent Eastern European immigrants. "The Jews come up to the College from the city, get all they can *from* from the College, and give nothing *to* the College," they wrote. Although Student Senators praised the high scholastic standing of their Jewish peers, they criticized their lack of support for college athletics as well as the war effort. "Speaking in general terms, the Jews have not enlisted in military service while the Gentiles have," they claimed (a false statement, as documents later showed). Furthermore, the Student Senators complained that "most of the Jews at Trinity are Russian," which they believed meant that every classroom "has a Russian socialistic expression of opinion." As a consequence, they told the Board that their classmates "hesitate about showing friends around the College, when they are sure to be greeted frequently by Jews." Board members asked President Luther to address this problem. [Student Senate committee letter, 24 April 1918, by Walter G. Smyth, Harmon T. Barber, Edward M. Hyland Jr., Edward G. Armstrong, and George C. Griffith, read aloud at 27 April 1918 Board meeting, @trinitycollegeBoardTrusteesMinutes1926, pp. 274-75. Smyth and Barber also were leaders of the student newspaper. @TripodElections1918]

President Luther presented more data and observations about Jewish students at the June 1918 Board meeting, He understood Trinity's larger problem was that World War I caused total enrollment to fall from around 250 to only 158 students in 1917-18, when many men left college to enlist in military service or join the workforce. The actual number of Jewish students remained relatively stable at 25 that year, but the proportion of Jews on campus had risen to 15 percent. Drawing on his personal observations of student life, Luther pointed to "a few of the Jews in College who, by reason of exceptional personal qualities, are cordially accepted as good fellows. The other students call them 'White Jews'." Luther's comment revealed how Trinity's dominant White Protestant culture considered most Jews to be *non-White* in this era, and assigned them to a lower position in the racial hierarchy. While Luther described Jews as "good scholars... who pay their bills," he concluded that "they are a definite hindrance to the growth of the College," and suggested ways that Trinity might deter their future enrollment, perhaps by mandatory Christian chapel services.^[President Luther report to Board of Trustees, 28 May 1918, read aloud at Board meeting, 14 June 1918 @trinitycollegeBoardTrusteesMinutes1926, pp. 276-278. On "White Jews," see @brodkinHowJewsBecame1998. Trinity re-instated compulsory chapel services on weekdays and Sundays in January 1919, "unless men are excused to attend church in town," @CompulsoryChapelTrinity1919]

One year later, Trinity student leaders continued to demand that the College reduce Jewish enrollments, but now cloaked their anti-Semitism in more publicly acceptable language of the era. The "Student Movement for Americanization at Trinity" submitted its resolutions to the Board of Trustees in April 1919, and demanded a reduction in "the undesirable element," a coded phrase that replaced direct references to "Jews" or "Hebrews." While Americanization proponents recognized that Trinity's charter promised equality of opportunity regardless of religion, they argued that "90% of the undesirable element lives in Hartford," and that the College needed to discourage local Jews from attending Trinity. They proposed a policy of "compulsory residence" in college dormitories "to influence and Americanize all students which cannot be done to some of the students while living at their homes."[Student Movement for Americanization at Trinity resolutions, presented at 26 April 1919 Board meeting, @trinitycollegeBoardTrusteesMinutes1926, pp. 320-321.]

Trinity leaders embraced this Americanization strategy by enacting an alien-residence policy. To address what some discreetly called "the particularly undesirable element which so seriously lowers the standing of the College," the Board voted to require on-campus dormitory residence for all freshmen and sophomore students "of alien birth, and... whose fathers were of alien birth," effective in Fall 1919. This alien-residence policy was designed to discourage Hartford Jews from attending (since they would have to pay additional residence fees rather than live at home), and to assimilate those who did enroll. The College focused only on students' first two formative years, in part because they lacked sufficient dormitories to mandate it for all students. Board members also discussed whether the alien-residence rule should appear in official College publications, and finally granted President Luther permission to do so. The outcome was a one-page supplement to the 1918-19 Trinity *Catalogue*, published at the end of the academic year in June 1919, so that hardly anyone would see it in print. The alien-residence rule did not appear in future editions of the *Catalogue*, nor the *Student Handbook*, nor the *Trinity Tripod* student newspaper, nor the *Hartford Courant* daily newspaper. This cleverly allowed Trinity leaders to hide the policy away from public view, yet still enforce a rule that was "on the books." ^[Report of the Special Committee, presented at 20 June 1919 Board meeting, p. 329-330; Motion voted on at 20 June 1919 Board meeting, p. 333-334; 20 June 1919 Board of Fellows report, p. 335, @trinitycollegeBoardTrusteesMinutes1926; @trinitycollegeSupplementCatalogueTrinity1918; @baldwinShadowIvoryTower2021, pp. 26-27. No mention of the alien-residence policy appeared in the Trinity College *Bulletin (Catalogue)* from 1919 to 1923, the Trinity *Student Handbook* for 1922-1923 (no issues available prior to 1916-17), the *Trinity Tripod* student newspaper for 1919, or the *Hartford Courant* daily newspaper.]

Trinity leaders definitely enforced their alien-residence policy. Officials reported to the Board in October 1919 that the rule was applied to 16 students, but "only three of these cases were Hebrews." This may have signaled that the policy began to meet its goal by deterring some Hartford Jews from applying, and assimilating others who chose to enroll. To avoid burdening non-Jewish immigrants, the Board refined its policy to exempt "students of alien parentage residing in other towns than Hartford" from the dormitory residence requirement, at the discretion of administrators. In other words, the son of a Swedish immigrant in West Hartford could attend Trinity while continuing to live at home, but the son of a Jewish immigrant in Hartford could not.^[Report of the Special Committee, presented at 20 June 1919 Board meeting, p. 329-330; Motion voted on at 20 June 1919 Board meeting, p. 333-334; 20 June 1919 Board of Fellows report, p. 335; 24 October 1919 Report of the Executive Committee to the Board, p. 341, @trinitycollegeBoardTrusteesMinutes1926]

Two years later, new Trinity President Remsen Ogilby asked the Board to grant him greater discretion over the College's alien-residence policy, while continuing to quietly limit the number of Jewish students. In June 1921, Ogilby asked the Board "for a reconsider of the rule requiring sons of foreign born to live on the campus," and noted that the rule "has caused bitter feelings in some quarters." Initially, Ogilby seemed to take a stand against treating Jewish students differently. "If the rule is intended to keep out the members of one single race," he warned, "it is not honest and rules out too many good students who would otherwise be with us." The Board voted to grant him the power to waive the resident rule on a case-by-case basis. Yet one year later, Ogilby reported on Trinity's success in reducing its Jewish population. "The number of Jewish students has been a matter of interest to many of us and has concerned two or three," Ogilby told the Board in 1922, attempting to minimize and put past controversies behind him. He proudly announced that "the percentage of Hebrews in the student body" had declined from 10.5 percent in 1921 to 9 percent in 1922. Interestingly, his presentation did not emphasize that the actual number of Jewish students had remained stable at around 25 (roughly the same number as in 1918), a fact that was disguised because the proportion of Jewish students declined after World War I, when Trinity's total enrollment rebounded to 268 men. Furthermore, Ogilby backed off his initial stance against treating Jewish students differently. In 1922 he presented additional suggestions on "limiting the number of Hebrew students" to the Board's Executive Committee, which they discussed, but took no action, at least on record. Unlike other institutions such as Harvard and Yale, there is no direct evidence that Trinity overtly or covertly invoked an admissions quota to reduce Jewish student enrollment. Instead, Trinity relied on its alien-residence policy to discourage Hartford Jews from attending, and to assimilate those who persisted. Since this rule was hidden from public view, and did not surface again in confidential Board minutes, we do not know when Trinity stopped enforcing it.^[17 June 1921 President Ogilby report to Board, p. 396; 18 June 1941 Board vote, p. 408; 28 October 1922, President Ogilby report to the Board, p. 439; 28 October 1922 Report of the Executive Committee, @trinitycollegeBoardTrusteesMinutes1926, p. 441. For comparisons with Harvard, Yale, and other institutions, see @synnottHalfOpenedDoorDiscrimination2017; @karabelChosenHiddenHistory2005]

To be clear, anti-Semitism among Trinity's Protestant leadership does not prove it was prevalent among West Hartford's Protestant property owners and town officials who objected to Jacob Goldberg's building permit in 1923. But these Trinity College documents demonstrate vibrant anti-Semitism at one of Hartford's most-respected institutions---notably one was founded on the tenets of religious tolerance---and that its leaders were skilled in hiding their anti-Jewish views and actions from the public eye. Further evidence reveals that anti-Semitism was not far beneath the surface in West Hartford. In 1925, Rabbi Abraham Feldman arrived in Hartford to lead Congregation Beth Israel, a Reform synagogue whose members were considering moving to West Hartford, and had purchased land on Farmington Avenue, not far from Goldberg's store. Feldman recalled some of his early, unpleasant encounters with West Hartford town leaders while speaking with an oral historian in 1974. "West Hartford was a closed community politically," Feldman recalled, labeling it "the most Republican town in the US" in the 1920s. Although Jews were just beginning to move from the city to the suburb, "there was no chance for a young Jew, or a Jewish lawyer... who wanted to enter the political life of the community," he remembered, adding that West Hartford's Protestant leaders "didn't want any Catholics, either."^[@MayBuildTemple1924; @feldmanOralHistoryInterview1974, p. 19.]

### Fighting Back {-}
Faced with these anti-Semitic barriers, many Hartford Jews fought back by gathering resources to create their own institutions during this era. Jewish doctors opened Hartford's Mount Sinai Hospital in 1923, and proudly declared that their doors were open "to all citizens regardless of race or creed." Connecticut's only Jewish-led hospital both served the needs of immigrant patients who were viewed as second-class citizens by other hospitals, and created employment opportunities for Jews in medical professions. Jacob's sister, Celia Goldberg Pessin, earned her nursing degree at New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital, and became the first Jewish woman to enter nurses training in Hartford. When Jewish lawyers were refused jobs at Hartford's corporate law firms, some opened their own smaller law offices. Another one of Jacob's sisters, Dora Goldberg Schatz, married attorney Nathan Schatz, who partnered with his brother Louis (a Jewish graduate of Trinity College) to create the Schatz and Schatz law firm in Hartford in 1917. In higher education, Rabbi Feldman also played an instrumental role in the founding of the University of Hartford, open to all students, in 1957.^[Mount Sinai Hospital opening in *Hartford Times* 3 March 1923, cited in @lazarusPracticeMedicinePrejudice1991, p. 36; @chameidesMountSinaiConnecticut2010; @NursingPioneerDies1975; @dalinMakingLifeBuilding1997, pp. 62, 78; @silvermanHartfordJews165919701970, p. 86; @RabbiAbrahamFeldman1967; @RabbiAbrahamFeldman1972; @UniversityHartfordEarly2005]

Jacob Goldberg also fought back. When the West Hartford building inspector refused to grant him a permit to construct his grocery store in January 1923, Goldberg hired an attorney and filed a lawsuit. (Perhaps he received informal advice from his brother-in-law Nathan Schatz, the Jewish attorney who was a rising figure in the Connecticut Republican party.) Goldberg's lawsuit challenged the constitutional authority of the local government to block construction of a building on the arbitrary grounds that "neighbors do not want it." The lawsuit spelled out how Goldberg employed a well-respected local architect, William T. Marchant, who designed the 80 by 60 foot store to conform with all aspects of the West Hartford building code. Furthermore, Marchant's design would be attractive, similar in style to several homes and other buildings he had designed in the area, not an eyesore. Goldberg's lawsuit claimed that West Hartford's building inspector was "exceeding his constitutional rights," even if the town government had delegated him "with such arbitrary powers." This fight over issuing a building permit to a Jewish Hartford grocer grabbed large headlines, especially when compared to a similar rejection to local Protestant businessman Fred Kenyon two months earlier, which barely made it into the news.^[@LegalFightStore1923; @WilliamMarchantCollection2021; @silvermanHartfordJews165919701970, p. 258. By comparsion, the rejection of Fred Kenyon's public garage permit at a December 14, 1922 public hearing was not reported at the time, and appeared near the bottom of a story six months later @WestHartfordHas1923]

```

Initially, West Hartford leaders fought back against Goldberg. Town Council members voted in March 1923 to task their attorney, and also to retain the services of a second attorney, to defend their building inspector's refusal to grant a permit. Behind the scenes, West Hartford's attorneys realized that Goldberg had a strong case. Without a clearly-defined policy, a court might rule that the Town had refused to grant him a permit for arbitrary reasons, and might reduce the Town's authority to reject other buildings in the future. Perhaps they also discussed the potential risks of bad press over a Protestant-led town government fighting to block a Jewish-owned grocery. In any case, the Town Council eventually relented. At the end of their June 1923 meeting, the Council went into a closed-door executive session, away from the press and the public. They quietly voted to approve Goldberg's building permit, and also created a committee to review local ordinances on building restrictions in residential areas, to ensure they were on stronger legal footing next time. The Council succeeded in keeping the Goldberg controversy out of the headlines, at least temporarily. The following day's news did not mention Goldberg by name, and only hinted at the end of the story that it was "unofficially rumored" that a permit would be granted.^[@DemandEconomyWest1923; @westhartfordTownCouncilMeeting1923, June 5, 1923, p. 210; @WestHartfordTax1923]

For a second time, West Hartford residents spoke out against Goldberg's proposed store. A group of 14 local property owners protested at the next Town Council meeting, and were represented by a spokesperson: real estate businessman M. Martin Kupperstein, who also was one of the few Jewish residents in the neighborhood. Perhaps he was selected to counter any perceptions that their opposition was anti-Semitic. After Kupperstein urged the Council to reverse its decision, the Town Council's attorney informed the protesters that they had examined Goldberg's case "from every possible angle" and decided "it would be a poor policy for the town to attempt to withhold the permit." To put it more simply, another council member stated that the Town would not prevail in court.^[@westhartfordTownCouncilMeeting1923, June 19, 1923, p. 211; @WestHartfordStore1923; @MorrisMartinKupperstein1938. Kupperstein resided at 847 Farmington Avenue, West Hartford, @GeerHartfordDirectory1923, p. 466.]

Who were these West Hartford property owners, and what motivated their protests against Goldberg's grocery store? With the exception of Kupperstein, none of their names appear in official minutes or news accounts of the two public hearings in 1923, nor do we have records of the words they spoke. Furthermore, while the *Hartford Courant* referred to this neighborhood as "one of West Hartford's exclusive residential sections," that description did not match Ardmore Road, where nearly every building was a two-family duplex, in contrast to several other nearby streets with more expensive single-family homes. Perhaps the relative affordability of two-family homes explained why Ardmore Road developed so rapidly, growing from 1 household in 1922 to over 40 households by 1926, according to city directory listings as shown in Table \@ref(tab:1922-26-ardmore-road). Interestingly, the proportion of households with Jewish names rose from 0 out of 13 in 1923 to 8 out of 43 (nearly 20 percent) by 1926, meaning that Ardmore Road also attracted a larger percentage of Jewish residents than probably any other street in West Hartford at that time. Moreover, the Catholic Church purchased a large parcel of land in October 1923 on Farmington Avenue, near the Ardmore Road intersection, where they built St. Thomas the Apostle Church, a structure nearly as large as the nearby Armory. To be clear, we do not know precisely which families lived on Ardmore Road in early 1923, nor could they predict the future, but the Goldberg store controversy may have symbolized that *their* neighborhood was rapidly changing.^[@LegalFightStore1923. Out of 54 buildings on Ardmore Road today, all appear to have been constructed as 2-family units except two addresses: 10 and 14. See Ardmore Road household data from Geer's City Directory listings, 1922-26, and West Hartford Voting Registration Records for Ardmore Road (1920-1926; transcribed by Jeff Murray in 2017 from West Hartford Historical Society archives), both available at https://github.com/OnTheLine/otl-ardmore-road-wh.]

After Jacob Goldberg finally won his building permit, Kingswood Market opened its doors for business in November 1924. He incorporated the business with his brother Barney and two brothers-in-law: attorney Nathan Schatz and Hyman M. Cohen, who managed the market. Jacob Goldberg also moved into the West Hartford neighborhood and purchased a single-family home on nearby Outlook Avenue. Two years later, the Goldberg family sold the business, and a series of owners continued to operate Kingswood Market for decades, until it was unable to compete against a much larger and more modern Whole Foods grocery store that opened four blocks away in 2005. Neighborhood residents mourned when Kingswood Market closed its doors in 2007.^[@KingswoodMarketHas1924; @KingswoodMarketCorporation1924; @CityHallMarket1924; @KingswoodMarket3rd1928; @KingswoodBuildingFarmington1926; @WestHartfordMen1952; @wfsbeyewitnessnewsKingswoodMarketClosing2007; @KingswoodMarketClosing2007. Jacob Goldberg resided at 17 Outlook Avenue in late 1924, @BuildingPermitsWorth1924].

West Hartford leaders and vocal property owners sought a legally-defensible policy that would allow them to reject certain real estate development they did not want in *their* rapidly-growing town. The Town Council concluded this controversial episode over Goldberg's grocery by creating a brand-new Zoning Commission to find better land-use regulations in July 1923. But concept of "zoning" was still new, and most Council members did not yet have a clear idea of how it would happen. At that same meeting, the attorney for Fred Kenyon, the local Protestant businessman whose public garage permit also had been denied, sought to re-open the issue for his client. Since the Town granted a building permit to Goldberg, he argued, shouldn't they also grant a permit to Kenyon? One Council member moved to refer the request to the Zoning Commission, but Kenyon's attorney objected because this brand-new entity "had not yet consulted any regulations." The Council concurred, but then voted to refer Kenyon's request back to the building inspector, which effectively stalled Kenyon's request, at least for the moment. In the meantime, pressure continued to mount on town leaders define exactly what they meant by zoning.^[@WestHartfordHas1923]

TODO: improve transition into next section: perserving property values by excluding outsiders... that were driven by a desire to keep *urban life* outside of their *small-town suburb*. OR to keep urban Hartford out of their newly-suburban small town.

TODO: the controversy over Goldberg's grocery store generated a fiercer debate than Kenyon's garage, and directly led West Hartford town leaders to enact local zoning laws


### Defining Zoning to Exclude {-}

How did leaders of Connecticut suburbs learn about zoning, and how did they define it in their local communities, both in their words and actions? West Hartford's history matters because it became the first municipality in Connecticut to act on the state's authority to create local zoning laws in 1924, and it set precedents that many other suburbs have followed for nearly a century. Like many policies, zoning can be defined to achieve very different goals, positive or negative, depending on whose interests are served. In the context of the controversy over Goldberg's grocery store, West Hartford leaders defined zoning as a legally-defensible strategy to preserve the property values of current suburban landowners by excluding urban outsiders they viewed as undesirable, without directly mentioning their race or religion. Zoning succeeded by using political tools to create higher-priced markets of single-family homes, which segregated communities by their access to wealth and limited who could afford to live there.

TODO: Decide if this fits above or not: Over time, exclusionary zoning became a powerful tool for suburban communities to separate themselves from urban neighbors they deemed a less desirable, and it did so without directly referring to their race or religion.....



Josiah B. Woods, a West Hartford town councilman, realized during the 1923 Goldberg grocery store controversy that a zoning policy was the solution he and others were looking for. .... became one of the town's strongest advocates for zoning and served on its zoning board into the 1940s....was the strongest advocate for West Hartford to adopt a zoning policy.... Educated at Amherst College and now a businessman, he recognized the problems stirred up by the Goldberg controversy and sought a solution that would not address conflicts in an arbitrary way, and replace it with a system-wide solution. Woods lobbied his West Hartford colleagues---and also legislators at the Capitol---to act on this issue. ... Woods lobbied CT legislature to pass a zoning enabling act... that allowed West Hartford and X other municipalities to pass local zoning ordinances.... In June 1923 [CHECK], just as the Goldberg controversy was dying down, Connecticut passed a law that allowed X municipalities to enact local zoning ordinances, and West Hartford became the first in the state to take advantage of this opportunity by enacting its local zoning policy in 1924.


Previously, cities like Baltimore, Maryland used *race-based zoning* to exclude Blacks from White neighborhoods, but the US Supreme Court overturned in CASE, not on civil rights grounds, but because the law infringed on White people's rights to sell private property to whomever they chose. CITE  In other words, Supreme Court upheld individual rights in a free-market economy.... in this case....  As a result, race-based zoning no longer was legal... and also unclear whether *any* form of zoning would be permissible under the logic that government should not interfere with free-market economy....


Zoning was redefined and promoted in early 1920s by US Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, who led the most activist federal government agency at this time...US Commerce Dept under Hoover was first activist federal agency; appointed Advisory Committee on City Planning and Zoning around 1921; included lawyer Edward M. Bassett of NY "known as Mr. Zoning"
Bassett drafted "standard zoning enabling act" in Dec 1921 @knackRealStoryStandard1996

At one level, zoning could be interpreted as a well-intentioned tool of Progressive-era government to exert greater control over the free market to protect the health and safety of residents. Zoning gave local municipalities the power to draw lines that separated land for different uses, such as keeping toxic factories away from residential homes and schools. [TODO: review to decide whether to cite here: @wolfZoningAmericaEuclid2008] Hoover's suggested text for states began by defining zoning "for the purpose of promoting health, safety, morals, or the general welfare of the community..." (p.4). Giving local governments the power to decide what types of buildings could be constructed would promote the public good by reducing street congestion, ensuring fire safety, prevent overcrowding, and so forth.... p6 @usdepartmentofcommerceStandardStateZoning1924 TODO: check and use???: In fact, Bassett helped make zoning law in NYC in 1916(?) as the solution to the problem of rising skyscrapers that blocked sunlight from smaller homes around them....

But at a deeper level, Hoover's definition of zoning redefined how local governments could legally exclude certain types of residents by limiting what types of housing could be constructed on the land. Inside Hoover's suggested text for zoning laws, immediately after the section on how zoning would promote the health and general welfare of a community, it also stated that zoning would maintain "the character of the district" and "conserving the value of buildings." p6 @usdepartmentofcommerceStandardStateZoning1924   How exactly would zoning preserve a neighborhood's character and property values?

Back in West Hartford, Josiah Woods translated these concepts to his Town Council colleagues....
But Josiah Woods explain the power of zoning differently to his West Hartford colleagues.
At that same meeting, councilman Josiah B. Woods asked colleagues to support his efforts to persuade the Connecticut state legislature to approve a "zoning act" that would allow municipalities such as West Hartford to draw up local ordinances "to protect the residential character" of specific areas. Although zoning was a relatively new concept for most Council members, the Town attorney sided with Woods and also recommended this strategy, noting that Connecticut's draft legislation was adopted from text proposed by the US Chamber of Commerce.^[Indirect quote on "protect the residential character" attributed to Woods in @DemandEconomyWest1923; @WestHartfordHopes1923. TODO: check WH Town Council minutes from 6 March 1923 meeting for relevant details or quotes.]

MERGE ABOVE: Looking back from 1940s: Zoning for preserving property values -- Zoning should be thought of in the light of protecting existing property values, Josiah B. Woods, veteran chairman of the Town Plan and Zoning Commission declared in a statement Sunday in which he said that personal antagonism to regulation hits been aroused in many cases and gives reasons why there should be no resentment in the future. WH zoing comm underlying policy is "to make West Hartford a suburban town 'for real homes'."
Direct quote of Woods on 20th anniversary of WH regarding "personal antagonism to regulations": "It is wise to go back to the fundamentals of zoning. The town is given the authority to make zones for the preservation of existing values... Zoning exists to protect those values...If this is fully understood, there should be no antagonism of any kind."
Recent amendment to zoning regs would give Zoning Board complete authority over all uses of buildings in residential zones except those exclusively used as dwellings, and Town Council turned it back to Comm one week ago. @ProtectionPropertyValues1944


Woods and others persuaded the CT legislature to approve the state's first zoning enabling law in 1923, which covered West Hartford and X other cities and towns....
1923 CT text was based on an earlier draft of Hoover and Bassett's text....
Courts unsure... Euclid case working its way up through lower courts... year?
Bassett came to CT to advise legislators on creating a stronger statewide CT zoning law, which passed in 1925 and covered all municipalities in the state (except New Haven). Language nearly identical to Bassett's suggested text.

After passage of the first CT zoning act in 1923, Josiah Woods led West Hartford town leaders in the sprint to be the first to take advantage of this opportunity to create a comprhensive zoning plan and local ordinances....
Town appointed Woods to be zoning commissioner....
Woods hired Robert Whitten, a consultant from Cleveland, Ohio, to guide West Hartford through the process.
Whitten's definition of zoning emphasized *exclusion* more than health and general welfare of the community.
ADD: Whitten was a member of Hoover's conference on planning new subdivisions and he also "designed Atlanta's racial zoning scheme in 1922 that flouted the Supreme Court's *Buchanan* decision" [Rothstein p62; see details p46]
Whitten also authored numerous zoning guidelines for cities in New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island...
@silverRacialOriginsZoning1997

In his preface, Whitten emphasized how West Hartford's zoning laws would bring.....
Whitten drafted West Hartford's first zoning guidelines, which emphasized how these land-use laws would bring "orderliness" and "efficiency" to real estate development in this rapidly growing suburb, "and an increase of health, comfort and happiness for all people."
The original report stated that West Hartford’s primary function was to serve the housing needs of “all classes and all grades of economic ability. . .[including] factory workers, office employees, and the various business and professional groups” who work in Hartford. ^[@whittenWestHartfordZoning1924, preface, other pages?]


But deeper inside Whitten's report, his strategy for segregating West Hartford neighborhoods by wealth became clear. Whitten recommended zoning laws that divided residential areas into sections A, B, C, D, and E, listed in decreasing order of the minimum size of land required for home construction. For example, building in the most exclusive "A" zone required the largest amount of land: at least 9,000 square feet (or 1/5 of an acre) for a single-family home, or twice as much land (18,000 square feet or 2/5 acre) for a two-family home. Also, the "A" zone required at least of XX feet of property facing the street, to spread homes further apart. As a result, homes in "A" zones would require more land per family, and therefore become more expensive than identical buildings in lower-rated zones.

...as shown in Table \@ref(tab:1924-zone).

*Zoning set minimum land requirements per family, which intentionally made it "uneconomic" to build more affordable multi-family housing in A and B areas. Green shading represents land per family. Icons by [Georgiana Ionescu](https://thenounproject.com/georgiana.ionescu/collection/real-estate-outline/).*



The purpose of zoning, as defined by West Hartford's 1924 plan, was to segregate neighborhoods by the wealth of their residents. Exclusionary language bluntly appeared in the body of the report. Zoning would "make it uneconomic to build two-family houses" in the "A" district because home builders would need to buy twice as much land, compared to the amount needed to build a single-family home. As a result of zoning, a typically more-affordable duplex home would become far less-affordable, and never be built in the "A" district.

TODO: How Zoning Made Two-Family Houses "Uneconomic" To Build
Use the same scale as diagram above and illustrate a single-family versus duplex on twice as much land (red X)

Exclusionary zoning required more land per family, which increased home prices to levels that only wealthier residents could afford. While zoning did not explicitly ban lower-class citizens, it effectively pushed them downward to the D-level districts (which permitted two-family duplexes with lower minimum property sizes), or out of the suburb entirely. Under the new zoning law, Hartford's tenement houses and apartment buildings, crowded with working-class families, would be "effectively prevented in West Hartford."^[@whittenWestHartfordZoning1924, p. 10.]

Zoning policies targeted future real estate development, because existing structures were grandfathered in.....

But less than a decade later, the Court's ruling in Euclid showed that government *could* limit individual rights to sale of property.... SEE MORE HERE and CHECK NOTES

Drafting local ordinances this way made zoning an exclusionary tool to restrict neighborhoods by wealth, and most likely to pump up high-end real estate sales. Unlike other tools developed around the same time (such as racially restrictive property covenants that prohibited non-white residents, and have since been outlawed by civil rights legislation), class-based zoning remains perfectly legal today.  But it does nothing to promote the health and safety of the citizenry, as promised by the original intent of the state law.
