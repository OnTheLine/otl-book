## Origins of Exclusionary Zoning {- #origins-zoning}

In present-day debates over housing, the phrase *exclusionary zoning* refers to local government policies that favor the construction of expensive single-family homes on large tracts of land, rather than more affordable multi-family homes on smaller properties, which limits who can afford to live there. In Connecticut, the origins of exclusionary zoning can be traced back to one suburban town's attempt to block an urban Jewish grocer from building a store in a residential neighborhood in 1924. While this conflict centered around commercial development, it triggered a new phase in ongoing disputes over who controlled real estate, and the legal tools that property owners and local governments used to separate themselves from people they deemed as undesirable neighbors. Unlike other discriminatory barriers of this era---such as [mortgage redlining](lending.html) and [restrictive covenants](restricting.html)---exclusionary zoning did not directly refer to race or religion. Instead, zoning policies cleverly carved up suburban neighborhoods with minimum home-size and property-size requirements that segregated residents by access to wealth. In this way, exclusionary zoning became a more sophisticated and so-called "color-blind" tool of housing discrimination that largely resisted fair-housing legislation of the 1960s-70s civil rights era, and continues to divide Connecticut into the present day.

When Jacob Solomon Goldberg returned home to Hartford after military service in World War I, he sought to advance himself from a butcher into a businessman. Jacob partnered with his brother Barney and their brother-in-law Hyman M. Cohen to buy a small grocery store in downtown Hartford, near their East Side neighborhood, which they managed together during the early 1920s. Like other entrepreneurs of their era, they "followed the trend of business to the west" and dreamed of opening a second grocery store in the rapidly-growing suburb of West Hartford. The town's population grew at a faster rate than Hartford during the 1910s and nearly doubled in size to almost 9,000 residents. West Hartford town officials granted more than 300 building permits for single- and two-family homes in 1922, more than any other town in Connecticut that year. Linked by convenient trolley lines to the capital city and corporate headquarters for the nation's leading banks and insurance companies, West Hartford was quickly becoming an ideal destination for the rising middle class.^[Jacob Solomon Goldberg (1891-1939) and his wife Anna Miller Goldberg should not be confused with other Hartford residents with similar names. @JacobGoldbergObituary1939 Jacob and his partners purchased and re-named the Guilfoil City Hall Grocery at 42 State Street, Hartford, in 1919.  @SecondAnniversaryCity1921; @KingswoodMarketHas1924; @connecticutstateboardofeducationSurveySchoolsWest1923, p. 103.]

Goldberg and his family searched for the perfect location to open a second grocery store. With funds from Jacob's father David, who previously owned one of Hartford's first kosher meat markets, they bought two valuable parcels of undeveloped land on Farmington Avenue at the corner of Ardmore Avenue, on the trolley line about halfway between the Hartford boundary line and West Hartford's town center. In the early 1920s, only a dozen grocers served the entire town, including several small shops that sold food products out of their homes. Nearby customers typically made frequent purchases during the week due to limited transportation and refrigeration. The closest competitors were located about a half-mile in opposite directions: West Hill Grocery (also on Farmington Avenue, closer to the Hartford border) and M.J. Burnham's (a larger store in West Hartford Center). Although the immediate area around Goldberg's property had only 60 houses in 1923, real estate developers and town officials had subdivided the land into smaller lots, and were building side streets and sewer lines, in anticipation of many more homebuyers. Next door to Goldberg's vacant lots stood the only non-residential building in the vicinity: the West Hartford Armory for the Connecticut National Guard Troop B Cavalry. Perhaps the odor from its horse stables may have explained why no one had yet built a home on Goldberg's empty property lots.^[When David Goldberg died in 1924, his estate valued the property at $40,000, and Jacob and his mother Rachel became its administrators. @DavidGoldbergObituary1924; @DavidGoldbergEstate1924; @ProbateCourtGoldberg1924; @silvermanHartfordJews165919701970, p. 170. West Hill Grocery was located at 765 Farmington Avenue, near the corner of Whiting Lane, and M.J. Burnham's was located at 19 South Main Street in West Hartford Center. @sanbornmapcompanySanbornFireInsurance1923; @GeerHartfordDirectory1923; @rossanoBuiltServeConnecticut2003.]

But when Goldberg applied for a building permit in January 1923, the West Hartford building inspector declined. Instead, the inspector called a public hearing, where "a score of property owners in the Ardmore road section appeared and protested" against Goldberg's plan to build a grocery in what the newspaper described as "one of West Hartford's exclusive residential sections." Property owners challenged Goldberg's right to build a store in *their* neighborhood, and the town government supported their objections by refusing to grant his building permit. In their eyes, it made no difference that Goldberg had followed all of the legal procedures and hired a well-respected local architect, William T. Marchant, to design the store to conform with the town's building code. The proposed store would measure 80 x 60 feet, larger than homes on Ardmore Road, but far smaller than the adjacent West Hartford Armory that also faced Farmington Avenue, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:otl-ardmore-1923).^[@LegalFightStore1923; @WilliamMarchantCollection2021]

(ref:otl-ardmore-1923) In 1923, West Hartford property owners and town officials objected to Jacob Goldberg's application to build a grocery store at the corner of Farmington Avenue and Ardmore Road (shown in blue), much smaller than the West Hartford Armory next door (shown in red). Although Goldberg eventually won and opened the Kingswood Market, this dispute motivated West Hartford to become the first municipality in Connecticut to enact zoning in 1924.

## Was Opposition Driven by Anti-Semitism? {- #anti-semitism}

Why did West Hartford property owners and town officials block Goldberg's building permit? Were they primarily opposed to a grocery story in their residential neighborhood---or to the presence of a Jewish grocer from Hartford? Jacob Goldberg probably asked himself these same questions.

On the surface, there is no evidence of overt anti-Semitism against Goldberg in this 1923 dispute. No one publicly uttered an anti-Jewish slur against him, nor did he publicly charge that he was rejected due to his religion, according to available records. In fact, a Protestant West Hartford real estate businessman, Fred Kenyon, confronted similar opposition to his development plans. Local property owners objected to Kenyon's proposal to construct a public garage on nearby Lancaster Road, which led the West Hartford building inspector to reject his permit in December 1922. Two months later, homeowners from nearby Fern Street filed a lawsuit against Kenyon's real estate company for removing a requirement that only single-family homes would be built in their neighborhood, fearing that the construction of apartment buildings would lower their property values. Since West Hartford residents and town officials blocked both Goldberg (a Jew) and Kenyon (an Episcopalian), religion was not the primary factor. ^[No evidence of overt anti-Semitism appears in the newspaper accounts of public meetings, nor in the sparse minutes from town council meetings on the matter. @westhartfordTownCouncilMeeting1923. Thanks to local historian Jeff Murray for his research and analysis about Fred Kenyon: @WestHartfordHas1923; @LandHouseRestriction1923; @FredKenyonDies1937]

Yet below the surface, the controversy over Goldberg's store arose during a period of intense anti-Semitism and anti-immigration in the Hartford region and the nation at large. Dominant Christians actively blocked or discouraged Jews from entering their institutions of medicine, law, higher education, and leisure. Even if no one publicly uttered an anti-Jewish slur at West Hartford's town hearings, leaders of local institutions spoke bluntly against Jews in their private meetings. To fully understand the climate of opposition to Goldberg's store, we need to look at public records of that particular event and also private records of surrounding events.

TODO: add this "both answers" line, or not? -- Overall, West Hartford property owners and town leaders blocked his building permit for two reasons....

When Jacob was growing up in Hartford's Jewish community in the early 1900s, he most likely heard the history of how freedom of religion was not originally extended to his people. Early Connecticut began as Christian colony, with no separation of church and state. After Reverend Thomas Hooker and his followers broke away from the Puritans and settled Connecticut in the 1630s, they established the Congregational Church as the seat of government in each town, and required residents to pay taxes to support its work. Despite the promise of freedom of religion in the First Amendment to the US Constitution in 1789, Connecticut did not disestablish the Congregational Church as the state religion until three decades later in 1818. That year, delegates to Connecticut's Constitutional Convention debated the topic of religious freedom, but deliberately voted to extend it only to "every society or denomination of Christians." Jews were not permitted to form their own congregations or worship publicly until 1843, when a delegation of German Jews persuaded the state legislature to grant this right by statute (though the state constitutional language remained overtly Christian until 1965).^[@dalinMakingLifeBuilding1997, pp. 10-13; @cohnCivilRightsJews2010; @hortonConnecticutStateConstitution2011, pp. 11-13; @finlayImportanceBeingPuritan2015; @furerChurchStateLand2018]

When Jacob reached his late 20s, Hartford was home to Connecticut's largest Jewish community, with about 11 percent of the city's population estimated to be Jewish in 1920. Most Jews were Eastern European immigrants who resided in crowded tenement buildings in the Front Street and Windsor Street neighborhoods, which experts had declared to be "the worst housing conditions in the country" among cities of Hartford's size. To earn a living, Jewish men commonly became peddlers who vocally advertised their goods up and down the streets, and maybe after gaining a foothold, opened a retail storefront. They sometimes came into conflict with Hartford Police over noise complaints in the streets, or doing business on Sundays in violation of Connecticut's Blue Laws to protect the Christian sabbath.^[@beckerJewishCommunityHartford1979; @veillerHousingConditionsTenement1903, p. 155; @dalinMakingLifeBuilding1997, chapter 4.]

Jacob entered the grocery business, just like his father, David. They embraced the retail sector in part because Hartford's Protestant elite blocked Jews from higher-status positions in other sectors. Although Hartford was one of the nation's insurance and banking centers, these institutions only hired a few Jews to serve as bookkeepers or sales agents, and did not allow them to rise into positions of responsibility until the 1950s. According to a survey of 800 officers and directors employed at Hartford's ten largest insurance companies and six largest banks in 1967, only 1 percent were Jewish (and most of them were concentrated in one bank). Both the Protestant-run Hartford Hospital and the Catholic-run St. Francis Hospital barred nearly all Jewish doctors, with rare exceptions, from practicing medicine at their facilities until World War II. These hospital hiring policies were "never written and seldom articulated," but clearly understood. Similarly, Hartford's top three corporate law firms---Robinson and Cole; Day, Berry, and Howard; and Shipman and Goodwin---refused to employ Jews through the 1950s, based on unwritten but widely recognized "gentlemen's agreements" that Jews should not apply, nor would they be considered.^[@silvermanHartfordJews165919701970, p. 86; @lazarusPracticeMedicinePrejudice1991, p. 24; @dalinMakingLifeBuilding1997, pp. 59, 78-82, 174-75; @huttonBriefLookBack2014].

TODO: Rewrite paragraph to show how anti-Semtitism visible in documents that elite never expected to be public, such as higher ed trustee minutes....

Although "unwritten" rules against Jews rarely appeared in the public documents of Hartford-area institutions, their leaders bluntly expressed anti-Semitic views in private meetings, where they did not anticipate that their words might one day become public.

TODO: transition here...

Anti-Semitism also influenced student and administrative leadership at Trinity College, Hartford's leading institution of higher education for men, during the World War I era. In 1918, a Student Senate committee warned the Board of Trustees that nearly 25 percent of the student body was Jewish (the actual figure was around 15 percent), and that most of them resided in Hartford. The student committee perceived this as problematic because Jewish students "get all they can *from* the College, and give nothing *to* the College," and also infused classrooms with "Russian socialistic" opinions rather than patriotic military service. When Trustees requested a response from Trinity President Flavel Luther, he reported that several Jewish students had performed military service, but nevertheless agreed that the rising number of Jews was a problem. Over the next three years, as the Student Senate continued to complain about an "undesirable element" in the student body, College leaders experimented with different policies designed to reduce Jewish enrollment (by strictly enforcing mandatory Christian chapel services) or to Americanize students from immigrant Hartford families (by requiring on-campus residence for the first two years of "all students of alien birth, and of all students whose fathers were of alien birth"). In 1921, the new Trinity President Remsen Ogilby received the Board's permission to waive these rules on a case-by-case basis. Unlike wealthier institutions such as Harvard and Yale, Trinity did not impose an admissions quota to reduce the number of Jewish students, because its budget depended heavily on Hartford-area enrollments (about half of the student body at that time) and their tuition dollars.^[@knappTrinityCollegeTwentieth2000, pp. 57-61.]

Their presence is resented ·by the other students and has occasioned· many protests from the alumni. There are not as many of them in College as some people seem to think, but there are enough to constitute a pretty definite problem, and if they increase, the matter may easily become serious. It is my conviction that the College should do its share in educating these aliens, whatever their race or religion, who come to our shores. Itis only by education that they can ever be assimilated and Americanized. At the same time we cannot afford to sacrifice any of the really higher interests of the college for the sake of a special class." p169; next paragraph: "In this connection I might say that several times I have been applied to by colored boys who wished to enter Trinity College.

Faced with anti-Semitic barriers in professional fields, some Hartford Jews created created their own institutions. ......, they established Hartford's Mount Sinai Hospital, the only Jewish hospital in Connecticut, in 1923.

First, the timing of this debate took place exactly when Jews were building their own hospitals and social centers to combat anti-Semitism in the Hartford region, as well as a rising anti-immigrant climate across the US during the early 1920s.

 Even if no one publicly uttered an anti-Jewish slur during this controversy, West Hartford property owners and town officials saw Goldberg as a *Jewish* businessman, an outsider in *their* community. As a result, the Goldberg controversy prompted town leaders to quickly adopt a zoning policy -- the first municipality in Connecticut to do so -- which intentionally segregated newly suburban neighborhoods by social class in order to defend [TODO: insert urban words from 1924 Whitten report]. As a result, exclusionary zoning became the dominant tool to segregate suburbs because it worked without directly referring to race or religion.





Second, the location of Goldberg's store was at the corner of Ardmore Road, a rapidly-developing neighborhood that attracted a larger number of middle-class Jewish homebuyers than any other part of this historically Protestant town at that time.






But even if no one publicly uttered an anti-Jewish slur, the controversy over Goldberg's grocery store generated a fiercer debate than Kenyon's garage, and directly led West Hartford town leaders to enact local zoning laws---the first municipality in Connecticut to do so---that were driven by a desire to keep *urban life* outside of their *small-town suburb*. OR to keep urban Hartford out of their newly-suburban small town.
This opposition to Hartford and its symbols -- crowded apartment buildings, poverty, etc. -- was tangled up with local property owners' perceptions of Goldberg as an *outsider* to their Protestant community....

Goldberg fought back. He was not shy about making bold real estate investments in downtown Hartford.[@NewTheaterState1923] Goldberg found a lawyer, perhaps through his brother-in-law, Judge TODO CHECK Nathan Schatz.  Goldberg's lawyer went to court in February 1923 to challenge the authority of town officials to arbitrarily block construction of the building.  [@LegalFightStore1923]





West Hartford fought back against Goldberg. In March 1923, Town Council members tasked their corporate counsel (Carlyle C. Thomson), as well as a second attorney (John T. Robinson), to defend their building inspector's refusal to grant the permit.[@DemandEconomyWest1923] But the Town Council's own attorneys advised them that they lacked legal authority to block the building permit. The Town Council relented and voted in favor of granting Goldberg the permit on June 5th.

But West Hartford property owners (or neighborhood residents?) did not give up. Two weeks later (June 19th), a group of TODO???label, led by Hartford real estate agent M. Martin Kupperstein, urged the Town Council to reverse its decision and continue to block Goldberg's building permit.
TODO ADD:
Once again, the Town's attorneys explained that West Hartford currently lacked the legal authority to block construction of an appropriately-designed building on the grounds that residents simply did not want it.[@WestHartfordStore1923]



Jacob Goldberg won this round and obtained his building permit to construct a grocery store. The Kingswood Market opened its doors in November 1924 [@KingswoodMarketHas1924; @CorporationPapersFiled1924]. Kingswood advertised jointly with Goldberg's downtown Hartford store [@CityHallMarket1924]

Goldberg purchased a nearby home on Outlook Avenue....[@BuildingPermitsWorth1924] Goldberg sold the business for $100,000 in 1926 to W.J. Gengras. [@KingswoodBuildingFarmington1926] In 1928, the store celebrated its 3rd anniversary with a full-page newspaper advertisement with photos of its expanded services, which now included a small cafe next door. [@KingswoodMarket3rd1928] Neighborhood residents shopped at their local grocery for decades until the business closed in 2007 due to increasing rents and tougher competition with newer competitors, such as Whole Foods [TODO confirm competition opening year].

At that same meeting, an attorney re-presented the case for his client Fred Kenyon, the real estate agent(?) whose application to build a garage also was rejected by the town building inspector a few months earlier
"The attorneys now feel that because the town recently granted a permit for a store on Farmington avenue at the corner of a residential street, and which permit had previously been refused, it should grant Mr. Kenyon's request." Council member moved to refer request to zoning commission, but attorney objects "because the commission had not yet consulted any regulations." Then referred to building inspector which "to all intents and purposes this kills the permit - at least for the present." @WestHartfordHas1923

West Hartford town leaders and vocal property owners desperately wanted to control the shape of real estate development in their rapidly-growing suburb... and they needed a defensible legal framework to protect their interests..... they sought expert advice from outside consultants on the relatively new field of zoning.

## Zoning to Separate Social Classes {- #zoning-to-separate}




DEFINE zoning and exclusionary zoning
CLARIFY that Jacob Goldberg sought to build a store, not a residence, but the conflict raised broader question: how much control should government exert over land-use, and how?


During the 1920s, several states granted local governments a new policy tool—known as municipal zoning—to exert greater control over land development. But tools can be used to achieve different goals. We can use them to help people or cause harm. Evaluating the history of zoning requires a closer look at how local governments implemented this policy, and to what ends.

Progressive advocates saw zoning as a necessary tool for government to regulate the free market and to protect the health and safety of its citizens. For example, zoning gave municipalities the power to draw lines on the land and create separate spaces for residential, commercial, and industrial development. Family homes could be legally separated from potentially harmful businesses or factories. When the Connecticut General Assembly approved zoning enabling law in 1923, it stated that local regulations should be designed for this purpose: "... to prevent a close arrangement or constructions of buildings upon the streets, to secure safety from fire and other dangers, to avoid undue concentration of population and to provide health, comfort and general welfare in living and working conditions."^[TODO: check original source, cited in @whittenWestHartfordZoning1924, p. 8; @PlansApportionPopulation1923]

But local governments often crafted zoning ordinances to achieve other, less innocent goals. Some wrote local ordinances that made housing construction in selected neighborhoods affordable only for upper-class families, thereby blocking out lower-income families. Today we call this "exclusionary zoning" and its roots can be traced back nearly a century ago.

West Hartford became the first Connecticut town to enact municipal zoning in 1924, immediately after the state granted this power. Town leaders hired Robert Whitten, a consultant from Cleveland, Ohio, to guide this process. He drafted West Hartford's first zoning guidelines, which emphasized how these land-use laws would bring "orderliness" and "efficiency" to real estate development in this rapidly growing suburb, "and an increase of health, comfort and happiness for all people."^[@whittenWestHartfordZoning1924, preface]

ADD: Whitten was a member of Hoover's conference on planning new subdivisions and he also "designed Atlanta's racial zoning scheme in 1922 that flouted the Supreme Court's *Buchanan* decision" [Rothstein p62; see details p46]




Whitten also recommended a system of dividing residential areas by minimum home construction sizes, to effectively segregate citizens by social class. In the most exclusive A district, constructing a single-family home required the largest size property lot (at least 9,000 square feet, or 1/5 of an acre), and building a two-family home required twice as much land. Similar rules mandated the minimum width of the property facing the street. The 1924 zoning plan clearly stated that these rules "will under most conditions, make it uneconomic to build two-family houses" in the A district. Exclusionary zoning required more land per family, which increased home prices to levels that only wealthier residents could afford. While zoning did not explicitly ban lower-class citizens, it effectively pushed them downward to the D-level districts (which permitted two-family duplexes with lower minimum property sizes), or out of the suburb entirely. Under the new zoning law, Hartford's tenement houses and apartment buildings, crowded with working-class families, would be "effectively prevented in West Hartford."^[@whittenWestHartfordZoning1924, p. 10.] West Hartford town leaders voted to adopt most of their consultant's recommendations.

Drafting local ordinances this way made zoning an exclusionary tool to restrict neighborhoods by wealth, and most likely to pump up high-end real estate sales. Unlike other tools developed around the same time (such as racially restrictive property covenants that prohibited non-white residents, and have since been outlawed by civil rights legislation), class-based zoning remains perfectly legal today.  But it does nothing to promote the health and safety of the citizenry, as promised by the original intent of the state law.
