Praying Across the Lines NOTES


- Notes from 15 Sept 2019 bike tour with Jewish Historical Society, led by Lance Goldberg with Jai Zion
- Follow up on this story told by Lance at former Emmanuel Synagogue 500 Woodland St (now Faith Seventh Day Adventist Church): in early 1950s, Hartford rabbi encouraged West Hartford families to create their own Emmanuel Synagogue, which he viewed as a satellite, and at that time, did not envision that the congregation would ever depart Hartford's North End neighborhood
- Emmanuel Synagogue leaders decided to move their school from Hartford to suburban West Hartford in 1959, then entire synagogue departed Hartford for West Hartford in 1961, long before late 1960s peak of racial conflict

Dear Tracey and Jack,

Hello!  The exciting news is that my Omeka site about Fern Street is now nearing completion.  There are a few edits and copyright requests pending, but here is a link to the site: https://fernstreetwesthartford.omeka.net/

I would love to get any general suggestions you might have, or learn of specific clarifications or edits needed in sections where I mention your work.  This was a very interesting project and I learned a tremendous amount about the town and early Hartford. I am so grateful for the body of work that you have each done!

Cheers,

Hi Deb

Congratulations on your Omeka site and thanks for sharing your work. Sorry for my delay in responding, as the end-of-semester always fills up my inbox.

You asked for feedback. My goal is to provide some constructive criticism that’s similar to what I would offer to graduate students working on public history projects or manuscripts for history journals. But I’m mindful that we don’t yet know one another very well, so am concerned that my feedback may sound negative, which is not my intent. Please feel free to use, modify, or ignore my comments below!

Overall, your site brings together a significant body of work. You’ve clearly read many highly relevant primary and secondary sources, and I thank you for introducing several of them to me.

But your site did not fully persuade me to accept your main argument:
"This site explores the history of the street which was 'redlined' by realtors in the 1900s to steer home buyers towards properties in specific sectors of town: Jews to the north, Protestants to the center, and Catholics to the south.”

Two reasons why I was not fully persuaded, and how your argument could be strengthened:

1) If you wish to argue that Jews generally lived in the north, Protestants in the center, and Catholics in the south side of town, then readers like me expect to see more geographic evidence of residential patterns. I realize that there is no US census data on religion. But a stronger case might create a map of religious buildings as proxy for where people affiliated with them may have lived. Some evidence fits your case: St. Brigid School is in the south side, and Emanuel Synagogue is in the north side. But other evidence does not fit your case: St. Thomas Middle School and Northwest Catholic are in the north side. You also cite evidence from Tracey’s book about Carnelli’s “Vatican Village” that does not support your argument because it’s in the north side.

Similarly, you could strengthen your claim by showing a map of the Jewish eruv, which is an official boundary recognized by observant Jews for Sabbath. See the 2018 eruv here (https://www.youngisraelwh.org/eruv), and note that these historical boundaries have changed as the Jewish population moved. But if you use the eruv evidence, it doesn’t fully support your claim, because while it’s predominantly in the north side, it also goes south of Fern St.

2) Even if you persuade readers that the three religious groups *generally* tended to live in different parts of town, your main argument also claims that this pattern was caused by real estate agents who steered homebuyers to these areas in the 1900s. When making bold claims that accuse people of discriminatory actions, be sure to back it up with direct evidence.
A) Mary Everett’s quote in the “From the Beginning” section is not persuavie direct evidence of real estate agents discriminating buyers by religion into three sections of town
B) Linda Hirsh’s 1993 Courant essay is stronger evidence, but only appeared as a link, and could be more effective if you discussed it in your main text
C) Similarly, William Hathaway’s 1994 Courant article is strong evidence, but only appears as a link and would be more effective if you discussed it in your main text.

Once again, I appreciate the work you’ve done, which definitely made me think more deeply about this topic, and I hope that my comments help you improve your work if you decide to spend more time on it.

Jack
