In response to the 1990s Sheff v O’Neill school segregation lawsuit, Connecticut dramatically expanded the number of voluntary school integration programs. There are now 40+ interdistrict magnet schools with specialized curricular themes and funding to attract both city and suburban families, with details listed on the Regional School Choice Office site.

At present, Spanish language immersion (or dual Spanish-English bilingual) is not yet a theme for any state-funded interdistrict magnet schools in the Hartford region. This has always puzzled me because Hartford had a rich history of bilingual education. The Ed Studies Program and community partners held a half-day conference on dual-language bilingual ed in 2013 to promote the concept. Interestingly, dual-language public education was part of Trinity's 1994 plan with city and suburban school districts for what eventually became the Learning Corridor magnet school complex across the street from our campus.

There’s some signs of progress. In 2020-21, the Hartford Public Schools rebranded one of its schools as the Dwight-Bellizzi Dual Language Academy for K-8 students. The school is *similar* to an interdistrict magnet school because both city and suburban families can enroll. But technically, it’s listed by the Regional School Choice Office as an “Open Choice” school with enrollment open to both Hartford and non-Hartford students, which means that it has fewer resources than a state-funded interdistrict magnet school.

Dwight-Bellizzi is located about 1-2 miles south of Trinity’s campus. Since they opened during the pandemic, I don’t have any direct knowledge of what their dual language curriculum actually looks like. To learn more, you or your candidate could reach out to:

Tony Davila, Principal of Dwight-Bellizzi Dual Language Academy

Daisy Torres, Director of English Learner Services, Dual, and World Languages for Hartford Public Schools, who led the team that created Dwight-Bellizzi Dual Language Academy
