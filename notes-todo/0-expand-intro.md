TODO: Write a simpler introduction to questions that all of us should be asking ourselves....
- How were homes and schools laid out?
- Why do people of the metro Hartford region live in different neighborhoods and attend different schools?
- What caused racial and economic patterns in housing and education?
-

Our present-day reality did not simply appear overnight, nor was it caused by fate... People made decisions, both in government and marketplace, that created boundaries that shaped our lives.... need to look back to the not-too-distant past to understand how we ended up here today.... cannot see a future without understanding how we arrived here...

Let’s stop writing books that by design, only reach a few hundred people. The typical academic book nowadays in feels like history of education or urban history reaches only X hundred people. For evidence see issues in the world cat and other snippets of sales figures, which typically are hidden from public view because no one‘s really proud of what’s happened. Imagine a new type of publishing model we are rather than wrapping the content inside a $40 package, It’s freely available and find a bowl on the web. We talk about the pressures of tenure-track positions, butMost academics in tenure-track positions already earn a salary anyways

The academic world incentivizes people to hyper specialize. Imagine books that are written more broadly to merge in Blinn concepts together rather than nearly burrow down one rabbit hole
