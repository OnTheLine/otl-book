TODO: Write a simpler introduction to questions that all of us should be asking ourselves....
- How were homes and schools laid out?
- Why do people of the metro Hartford region live in different neighborhoods and attend different schools?
- What caused racial and economic patterns in housing and education?
-

Our present-day reality did not simply appear overnight, nor was it caused by fate... People made decisions, both in government and marketplace, that created boundaries that shaped our lives.... need to look back to the not-too-distant past to understand how we ended up here today.... cannot see a future without understanding how we arrived here...

My contributors and I intentionally wrote this book and made it freely available on the web to engage with everyday readers, especially those who live in the Hartford region.
We posted sections of the book online as we (slowly) wrote them, rather than hiding them out of sight until the final manuscript was finished.
The book improved greatly thanks to readers of the early online drafts who reached out to ask questions, share links, and challenge our interpretations. All of these interactions showed that history matters, and motivated us to work harder on revising and finishing the text.

Some of our readers are... [describe demographics, experience, and education levels....]

We do not assume that our readers have graduate degrees in urban history or educational policy, nor do they follow insider debates between academics...
We choose our words carefully and favor common terms over specialized vocabulary that socially distances authors from everyday readers...
Also, we carefully integrate pictures into our paragraphs, because images can communicate complex ideas to wider audiences more effectively than words alone. For example, it's much easier to explain mortgage 'redlining' or exclusionary zoning with interactive maps that display the evidence to our eyes and reveal the often-hidden boundary lines. But pictures cannot do this alone. They also require easy-to-understand explanations to reveal the underlying relationships between homeowners, government, and real estate interests.

If we want to dismantle *systemic racism* and related power structures, we need to understand how these *systems* actually work.

Let’s stop writing books that by design, only reach a few hundred people. The typical academic book nowadays in feels like history of education or urban history reaches only X hundred people. For evidence see issues in the world cat and other snippets of sales figures, which typically are hidden from public view because no one‘s really proud of what’s happened. Imagine a new type of publishing model we are rather than wrapping the content inside a $40 package, It’s freely available and find a bowl on the web. We talk about the pressures of tenure-track positions, butMost academics in tenure-track positions already earn a salary anyways

The academic world incentivizes people to hyper specialize. Imagine books that are written more broadly to merge in Blinn concepts together rather than nearly burrow down one rabbit hole
