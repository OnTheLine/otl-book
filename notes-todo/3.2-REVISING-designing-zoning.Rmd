### Designing Zoning to Exclude {- #designing-zoning}
Josiah Woods pushed West Hartford to move as quickly as possible to become Connecticut's first municipality to act on its new local zoning powers. With the Goldberg controversy still hanging over their heads, the Town Council quickly appointed a Zoning Commission (chaired by Woods), and allocated funds to hire zoning attorney Edward Bassett to advise them on next steps in the summer of 1923. Bassett cautioned Woods and his colleagues that "all zoning must be constructive and not arbitrary," in order to avoid legal challenges in court. Furthermore, zoning policies affected only future construction in this fast-growing suburb, and would not apply retroactively to existing buildings.^[@ZoningCommissionBe1923; @WestHartfordHas1923; @MoneyWestHartford1923; @ZoningCommissionReady1923]

West Hartford also hired Robert Harvey Whitten, an urban planner who helped Bassett create New York City's zoning code, and also served as a zoning consultant for Cleveland, Ohio; Atlanta, Georgia; and several cities in New England states. In each of these places, Whitten's job was to design the details of a zoning plan and draft them into a public document to persuade local leaders and their constituents to support it. His 1921 *[Cleveland Zone Plan](http://hdl.handle.net/2027/yale.39002044619519)* featured many visual elements, including diagrams of the dangers of mixing residential and commercial buildings, and photographs of apartment buildings intruding on single-family homes, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1921-whitten-cleveland). Whitten's vision of urban planning emphasized homogeneity, with uniform building types in the same neighborhood. Zoning is "like good housekeeping," he quipped. "It provides a place for everything and tries to keep everything in its place."^[@ExpertZoningEngaged1923; @RobertWhittenCity1936; @whittenClevelandZonePlan1921]

Whitten's dream of purely homogenous housing led him to propose zoning for racial separation. Despite the US Supreme Court's 1917 Buchanan v. Warley ruling against this policy, his 1922 *[Atlanta Zone Plan](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Atlanta_Zone_Plan/MmNAAQAAMAAJ)*, published by city officials, directly called for "Race Zoning" to divide residential areas into "white", "colored", and "undetermined" districts. Under Whitten's plan, Black families were not permitted to move into homes in White zones that they did not occupy prior to the passage of the proposed zoning law, and vice versa. "Race zoning is essential in the interest of the public peace, order and security," Whitten wrote, "and will promote the welfare and prosperity of both the white and colored race." Although the Georgia Supreme Court ruled that this plan was unconstitutional, Atlanta's city planners relied on Whitten's race-based zoning maps in future decades. Whether they explicitly called for racial separation (as Whitten did in the South), or discreetly avoided any direct mention of race, religion, or nationality (as Whitten did in the North), urban planners of the 1920s commonly used zoning as a tool for social separation.^[@whittenAtlantaZonePlan1922, p. 10; @silverRacialOriginsZoning1997; @rothsteinColorLawForgotten2017, pp. 46-53]

Whitten crafted the 1924 *[West Hartford Zoning](https://www.google.com/books/edition/West_Hartford_Zoning/bdKsAAAAMAAJ)* report to blend the soft rhetoric of inclusion with hard rules of exclusion. The introduction promised that zoning would bring "orderliness" and "efficiency" to the town's rapid growth, with "an increase of health, comfort and happiness for all people." It recognized that the suburb's primary function was to provide housing for people who worked in the adjacent city of Hartford and to serve "all classes and all grades of economic ability," including "factory workers, office employees, and the various business and professional groups." But deep inside the report, Whitten designed a system to economically segregate residents into homogenous neighborhoods with rules that dictated home prices. The plan divided West Hartford's residential areas into five sections---A, B, C, D, and E---based on the minimum amount of land per family that the new law required to build housing, as shown in Table \@ref(tab:1924-zone). The most exclusive A zones were designated for upper-income single-family homes because they required at least 9,000 square feet of land (1/5 of an acre) per family. At the opposite end were the C, D, and E zones, set aside for more affordable multi-family duplexes, triples, and apartments, where the rules required significantly less land per family. Additional guidelines increased the amount of land needed to build in more exclusive areas: A-zone homes could occupy no more than 30 percent of the property lot, and also must be 60 feet wide on the street-facing side in order to spread them further apart. While these 1920s rules may seem modest by today's standards (where many Connecticut suburbs now require more than 1 acre of land for a single-family home), Whitten recommended *nearly twice* the amount of land per family in West Hartford's most exclusive zone compared to similar zones in Cleveland and Atlanta.^[@whittenWestHartfordZoning1924, pp. 1, 2, 10, 13. Whitten recommended a minimum of 5,000 square feet of land per family in A-1 zones in Cleveland and Atlanta, @whittenClevelandZonePlan1921, p. 12; @whittenAtlantaZonePlan1922, p. 13.

Overall, West Hartford's 1924 zoning formula relied on minimum-land rules to create separate neighborhoods for expensive single-family homes versus affordable multi-family homes, and to physically distance these residents from each other. Whitten's report bluntly stated its objectives. Zoning made it "uneconomic to build two-family houses" in A and B areas because real estate developers needed to buy *twice* as much land compared to the amount needed for a single-family home, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1924-whitten-highlight-10). Given the same land costs, developers would generate more profits by building and selling two single-family homes, rather than one two-family home. While "three-family houses and apartments houses are not prohibited in the A, B, or C area districts," Whitten clarified, his zoning laws would influence the marketplace by removing incentives to build mixed-income housing. The new rules rewarded developers who built exclusionary neighborhoods.^[@whittenWestHartfordZoning1924, p. 10.]


(ref:1924-whitten-highlight-10) Whitten's zoning plan for West Hartford demonstrated how local governments could create minimum-land rules that made it "uneconomic" for private real estate developers to build multi-family housing in areas designated for single-family homes, thereby creating powerful incentives for exclusion.

To be clear, Whitten's zoning plan did not exclude all multi-family housing from West Hartford. But the plan pushed lower-income families into lower-rated C, D, and E areas---the only zones where duplexes, triples, and apartments could economically be constructed---which made it more difficult to find affordable housing in the suburb. Overall, exclusionary zoning was designed to reduce the amount of multi-family housing that developers would have built. Whitten's 1924 report cautioned readers about multi-family housing taking over suburban space that, in his view, should be reserved for single-family homes. It featured photographs with captions warning that "large apartment houses are spreading farther west along Farmington Avenue and into side streets," taken in the same area as the Goldberg grocery store controversy the prior year. Although the zoning plan did not prohibit apartment houses, the minimum-land rules and related guidelines ensured that "crowded tenement house conditions [that] exist in many larger communities," such as the city of Hartford, "will be effectively prevented in West Hartford."^[@whittenWestHartfordZoning1924, pp. 10, 12, 16, 17]

(ref:1924-whitten-apartments-p17-16) Robert Whitten's 1924 *West Hartford Zoning* report warned about the dangers of apartment buildings "spreading farther west" from the city into the suburb where, in his view, single-family homes belonged.

Josiah Woods and his colleagues embraced Whitten's zoning plan for West Hartford. As the Zoning Commission chairman, Woods wrote the foreword to the published report, which called attention to the need for an "orderly" plan for developing the suburb's "large unbuilt areas" in the near future. After public discussions and some minor adjustments, the Town Council voted to approve nearly all of their consultant's recommendations in March 1924, and became Connecticut's first municipality to enact local zoning ordinances, only nine months after the state enabling act. New York City zoning attorney Edward Bassett sent his compliments to West Hartford on their fast adoption of Whitten's recommendations. The Connecticut Chamber of Commerce brought Bassett back the following year, to advise more towns that sought to be granted the same zoning powers as West Hartford. Bassett persuaded them to drop their individual petitions for zoning, which he argued would be found unconstitutional, and instead to support a state-wide comprehensive bill that he assured them would "stand the tests of the court." Local leaders followed Bassett's advice, and Connecticut passed its second enabling act in 1925, a more comprehensive bill that expanded zoning power to nearly all 169 municipalities across the state.^[@whittenWestHartfordZoning1924, p. 1; @FramingZoningSystem1924; @ZoningPlanWest1924. See seven minor adjustments listed in @ZoningCommissionPlan1924; @VoteSupportZoning1925; Connecticut's 1925 zoning act specifically exempted the city of New Haven. @connecticutgeneralassemblyPublicAct2421925]

Bassett's prediction was correct. In 1926, the US Supreme Court voted 6-3 in the Euclid v. Ambler case to uphold local government's right to zoning, based on this test case where a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio created residential zones that blocked a landowner from selling their property for industrial use. This landmark ruling represented a major shift in the interpretation of US law. In the 1917 Buchanan case, the Court ruled against racial zoning on the grounds that local government infringed on individual rights to sell property to whomever they chose. But less than a decade later in the Euclid case, the court's majority agreed that local governments *could* limit individual rights to property as long as they "find their justification... for the public welfare." Zoning laws are constitutional unless they are "clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare" of the community. This language precisely matched the state zoning enabling bill text that Bassett, Hoover, and other zoning advocates recommended. Also, while the Euclid case on industrial versus residential zoning did not require the Court to rule on the exclusionary minimum-land regulations that towns like West Hartford had implemented, the Court made its views on multi-family housing very clear: "very often the apartment house is a mere parasite, constructed in order to take advantage of the open spaces and attractive surroundings" created by single-family homes, which are threatened by the growth of multi-family homes.^[@euclidv.amblerDecision1926; @freundColoredPropertyState2007, pp. 81-87; @rothsteinColorLawForgotten2017, pp. 52-53]

The US Supreme Court's ruling in Euclid emboldened local governments to enact more exclusionary zoning. Back in West Hartford, the fast-changing real estate market led some developers to test the boundaries by buying sufficient land to meet the minimum requirements to build 6-family and 12-family apartments in A and B zones, which Whitten intended for single-family homes. The Town Council responded with more restrictive zoning in 1927, and voted for an outright ban against apartment buildings in A and B areas, regardless of the amount of land per family. Once again, local government protected single-family housing and prevented multi-family housing, with little justification on how its laws served the general welfare of the community.^[@12FamilyApartmentWay1926; @ApartmentsBannedAreas1927]






As local governmental power to implement exclusionary zoning grew during the next few decades, the soft rhetoric of public health and community welfare steadily slipped away. We can see the changes most clearly in the words spoken by Josiah Woods, who served on West Hartford's zoning commission from its origins until 1945???

Originally, Woods defended zoning on the grounds that it protected "residential character..."

Back in the 1920s... Josiah

SECTION CONCLUSION
Josiah B. Woods served on West Hartford's zoning policy boards, in one capacity or another, from its origins in the early 1920s to its maturity in the early 1940s..... --- zoning defined in suburbia as a system to protect property values by defending single-family homes from urban intrusions.... The soft rhetoric of general health and welfare had dropped away...   WOODS........ Looking back from 1940s: Zoning for preserving property values -- Zoning should be thought of in the light of protecting existing property values, Josiah B. Woods, veteran chairman of the Town Plan and Zoning Commission declared in a statement Sunday in which he said that personal antagonism to regulation hits been aroused in many cases and gives reasons why there should be no resentment in the future. WH zoing comm underlying policy is "to make West Hartford a suburban town 'for real homes'."
Direct quote of Woods on 20th anniversary of WH regarding "personal antagonism to regulations": "It is wise to go back to the fundamentals of zoning. The town is given the authority to make zones for the preservation of existing values... Zoning exists to protect those values...If this is fully understood, there should be no antagonism of any kind."
Recent amendment to zoning regs would give Zoning Board complete authority over all uses of buildings in residential zones except those exclusively used as dwellings, and Town Council turned it back to Comm one week ago. @ProtectionPropertyValues1944

Drafting local ordinances this way made zoning an exclusionary tool to restrict neighborhoods by wealth, and most likely to pump up high-end real estate sales. Unlike other tools developed around the same time (such as racially restrictive property covenants that prohibited non-white residents, and have since been outlawed by civil rights legislation), wealth-based zoning remains perfectly legal today. But it does nothing to promote the health and safety of the citizenry, as promised by the original intent of the state law.

TODO -- reconstruct sources for Case Study: Avon (analysis of Professor Anika Singh Lemar, Yale Law School) in @boggsYourFairShare2020

1948  15,000 sq ft minimum parcel

1951 rezoned area west of Farmington River to min 2 acre parcels

1953 rezoned area east of Farmington River to min 30,000 sq ft

1957 rezoned portions of eastern area to min 40,000 sq ft; anticipates possibility of apartments by conditional permit

by 1967 vast majority of Avon is zoned for 1 acre and 2 acre lots; discrete areas zoned for commercial and industrial

Why did zoning not happen earlier in these towns?
- zoning infringed on individual rights of residents to use property as they wish, a core principle in rural comm.
- but as rural towns experienced rapid real estate development, they adopted suburban governments that traded individual rights for group protection against threats of urban life, such as apartment buildings with lower-income outsiders to their community

Why did zoning matter?
- zoning is built into the environment; once zoned for single-family homes, and those are built out, hard to make change
- zoning by local government inherently protects the interests of current residents, not interests of the metro region or the state in providing affordable housing opportunities for all residents...
