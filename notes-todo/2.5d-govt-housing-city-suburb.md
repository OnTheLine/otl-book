TODO: calculate percentage of suburban population lived in government-subsidized homes

Suburban flight away from city identified as problem by Hartford leaders in 1939 -- not simply a white flight 1960s issue

NOTE that "bled white" metaphor below was probably intended with financial emphasis, but also carries racial meaning
HHA Allen: "The 'mother' cities in metropolitan districts are being bled white by this exodus of their population, and in no distant future are there cities going to be faced with serious financial problems resulting from excessive reductions in assessed valuations." @NeedHousing121939
Guy Larcom City Plan worries about city-to-suburb decentralization and how it may be caused by lack of affordable housing in the city @GuyLarcomGives1940



New Deal policy focus on private vs public housing
“The New Deal faced a choice in the housing field. It could take [John Maynard] Keynes’ advice and get behind proposals from congressional liberals like Robert Wagner for large-scale, Europeanstyle public housing programs. Or it could follow [Herbert] Hoover’s lead and seek measures to stimulate private home building and individual home ownership.” US chose latter.
[from Starchman] As Kennedy continued, the New Deal policies also highlighted the repercussions when the government fails to keep pace with the private sector, and the effect of choosing Hoover’s housing plan over Keynes’ became obvious. While one percent in the U.S. lived in public housing after WWII, nearly half the population of England and more than a third of the population of France lived in public housing.11 Those who benefited from public housing in the U.S. were often the poorest of the poor, rather than the working class, who were the most common beneficiaries of Europe’s housing reforms. What is more, Hoover’s plan supported later housing policy that allowed suburbs to make the decision not to build public housing; consequently public housing developed around core urban areas and concentrated poverty. By experimenting with public housing and subsidization, what the New Deal housing reforms did was to increase the amount of owner-occupied housing, and the impact of the FHA on the number of owners was outstanding. Whereas before the New Deal, “only about four Americans in ten lived in their own homes... By the opening of the twenty-first century, nearly 70 percent were homeowners.” @kennedyWhatNewDeal2009, cited in @starchmanStruggleMeetHousing2011

Hartford housing leaders called for public housing when private market cannot deliver, and noted how roads, schools, and libraries all are government-subsidized; see quotes @HousingDeclaredAccepted1938; @GovtHousingNeed1938; Russell Allen, HHA permanent secretary and chief administrative officer, studied housing in Europe and also systems around US

## Returning Public Housing to Private Sector

A year before the end of World War II, US Congressmen toured public housing in Hartford region with aim to dismantle it and return housing to the private sector.
1944 Congressional Group, Impressed by Projects Here, to Recommend Policy Would Dismantle Aircraft Houses Flimsy Dwellings Having Served Purpose Held Now Valuable Only as Salvage
Representative Frank W. Boykin, Democrat, of Alabama, chairman of a subcommittee of the House Public Buildings and Grounds Committee said Monday following a tour of slum-clearance and war housing projects in Hartford, West Hartford, East Hartford and Wethersfield that he was in favor of dismantling many of the temporary projects, salvaging whatever is possible and letting private enterprises take over the job of providing adequate homes in the postwar world.
Better-built projects: Blue Hills Homes, Hartford,; Westview Homes, Wethersfield; Mayberry Village, East Hartford; Charter Oak Terrace, West Hartford [actually Hartford]. Rep Boykin favors allowing current tenants to buy units
Mistakes: North End Homes, East Hartford; Oakwood Acres, West Hartford "which are largely untenanted"; but "suitable for a man to live in"; Airport Homes, Hartford "terrible"
Slum clearance projects in Hartford: Bellevue Square; Nelton Court, Dutch Point Colony; almost fully occupied; some tenants earn $80/week and Rep Boynkin says that they should be moved out and not subsidized by the rest of the city
Greater Hartford projects compare well to other US region wartime housing projects @FavorsWarHome1944

"West Hartford’s three war housing projects, Elmwood Acres (on Elmhurst Street) with 300 units, Oakwood Acres (where Kennedy Park is today) with 335 units, and South Quaker Terrace with 159 units, (on Quaker Lane near the National Guard) all opened between 1942 and 1943. Oakwood Acres and South Quaker Terrace had a total of 494 housing units. Elmwood Acres consisted of small single-family homes and duplexes that are still inhabited.
According to the Lanham Act, when the war ended, the housing would be torn down. The Oakwood and Trout Brook Acres housing was built very quickly and was not meant to last. And, post-war, towns worried about the developments becoming low-income housing."

Elmwood Acres was higher-quality permanent housing that government sold off to private owners
...In 1956, the government began selling the houses for $6,000 to $7,000. Many of the residents, with growing families and upwardly mobile aspirations, left the neighborhood.
@altimariReunionRecallOld1996

"The grand list grew almost 7% from 1956 to 1957. The main factor in the grand list increase, according to the Hartford Courant, was the addition of 187 homes in Elmwood Acres housing project just south of Route 84 and east of Mayflower Street. These homes, built by the federal government during World War II as war worker housing, were sold to individual owners in 1956, adding over $1 million worth of property to the grand list. New homes, numbering 572, were also added to the list."
