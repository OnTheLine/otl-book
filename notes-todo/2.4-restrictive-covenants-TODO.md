Restrictive covenants TODO

Ali

Thanks for recommending further investigation of **68 Foxcroft Road**.

When my students and I researched restrictive covenants in West Hartford town records years ago, we looked at several addresses on Foxcroft to attempt to verify these oral accounts as told to Tracey Wilson:

By word of mouth I had heard that in the 1930s and 1940s and into the 1950s, no Roman Catholics could live on Stoner Drive, the first street developed on “the mountain.” No Catholics could buy on Wood Pond or Sunset Farms or West Hill or Sunnyreach. According to another resident, the address of a house on the corner of Foxcroft Road and Fern Street was changed to Fern Street because no Jews were allowed on Foxcroft Rd. But how many of these restrictions actually appear in West Hartford in writing and on legal documents? They have been hard to find in writing.

We did not find anything on Foxcroft Road at that time, but I’ll add it to my list of addresses to check again when Town Hall opens up again.

Thanks for the time today!

Sorry we had to hop off quickly, thanks for the time. I'll get to some sleuthing and also be in touch with some Waterbury historians. I'll let you know if I find anything.

The address I mentioned is 68 Foxcroft Road. I think you'll find it a little tricky because I think she told me they pieced together a few properties to create that larger than after one at some point.

Thanks again,
Ali
