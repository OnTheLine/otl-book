Restrictive covenants TODO

Historical memory and CT politicians:
@keatingDejaVuMoment2010
"During his 1990 race for attorney general - his first for statewide office - Blumenthal needed to address a report that a restrictive covenant on his home mortgage in Stamford prevented the sale of the property to African Americans."
see details in @jacklinCivilityGettingTrampled1990
Found the Shari Cantor interview here:
Naperville Heritage Society, “West Hartford, Connecticut,” Unvarnished: A History of Housing Discrimination in the Northern and Western United States, 2022, https://unvarnishedhistory.org/local-spotlights/west-hartford-connecticut/.

Interesting how the West Hartford Historical Society collaborated on this grant-funded history project, but I don't see any link to it on the Noah Webster/WHHS website! Only a very brief mention of the "Unvarnished" project (without a link) in this calendar event listing.

See also how Shari Cantor briefly mentions the covenant, and her general views on affordable housing policy here:
Alex Putterman, “West Hartford Is Mostly White, While Bloomfield Is Largely Black; How That Came to Be Tells the Story of Racism and Segregation in American Suburbs,” Hartford Courant, February 21, 2021, sec.

** See also how Tracey Wilson wrote about Shari Cantor's experience in this article, but does not refer to a restrictive covenant. Instead, Tracy writes:
By contrast, Shari Cantor, West Hartford’s current mayor and a resident on Colony Road since 2009, and others from the neighborhood say that Jews were excluded from buying on that street for many decades after the ample Tudor homes were built in 1929 and 1930. A look at the names from the city directory in 1958 supportsthis assertion.

Thanks for recommending further investigation of **68 Foxcroft Road**.
When my students and I researched restrictive covenants in West Hartford town records years ago, we looked at several addresses on Foxcroft to attempt to verify these oral accounts as told to Tracey Wilson:
By word of mouth I had heard that in the 1930s and 1940s and into the 1950s, no Roman Catholics could live on Stoner Drive, the first street developed on “the mountain.” No Catholics could buy on Wood Pond or Sunset Farms or West Hill or Sunnyreach. According to another resident, the address of a house on the corner of Foxcroft Road and Fern Street was changed to Fern Street because no Jews were allowed on Foxcroft Rd. But how many of these restrictions actually appear in West Hartford in writing and on legal documents? They have been hard to find in writing.

We did not find anything on Foxcroft Road at that time, but I’ll add it to my list of addresses to check again when Town Hall opens up again.

Thanks for the time today!
Sorry we had to hop off quickly, thanks for the time. I'll get to some sleuthing and also be in touch with some Waterbury historians. I'll let you know if I find anything.
The address I mentioned is 68 Foxcroft Road. I think you'll find it a little tricky because I think she told me they pieced together a few properties to create that larger than after one at some point.
Thanks again,
Ali
