Restrictive covenants TODO

Ali

Thanks for recommending further investigation of **68 Foxcroft Road**.

When my students and I researched restrictive covenants in West Hartford town records years ago, we looked at several addresses on Foxcroft to attempt to verify these oral accounts as told to Tracey Wilson:

By word of mouth I had heard that in the 1930s and 1940s and into the 1950s, no Roman Catholics could live on Stoner Drive, the first street developed on “the mountain.” No Catholics could buy on Wood Pond or Sunset Farms or West Hill or Sunnyreach. According to another resident, the address of a house on the corner of Foxcroft Road and Fern Street was changed to Fern Street because no Jews were allowed on Foxcroft Rd. But how many of these restrictions actually appear in West Hartford in writing and on legal documents? They have been hard to find in writing.

We did not find anything on Foxcroft Road at that time, but I’ll add it to my list of addresses to check again when Town Hall opens up again.

Thanks for the time today!

Sorry we had to hop off quickly, thanks for the time. I'll get to some sleuthing and also be in touch with some Waterbury historians. I'll let you know if I find anything.

The address I mentioned is 68 Foxcroft Road. I think you'll find it a little tricky because I think she told me they pieced together a few properties to create that larger than after one at some point.

Thanks again,

ADD from David Ware on Manchester:

- Race restrictive covenants were somewhat hidden in property deeds: "This was one of thirteen covenants, lettered A-M, that were included in every deed originally granted by Greenway Incorporated to the purchasers of properties within the subdivision.5 Placed smack in the middle of the thirteen common covenants, at letter F, this racially restrictive provision was fundamentally different from the other twelve that surrounded it. The others pertained to practical and common concerns such as limits on the size of structures, set-back requirements, prohibitions on “noxious” or unsafe industrial uses, the minimal value of homes to be built on the lots, etc. Covenant F, on the other hand, was a blatant expression of racist attitude and intent. It was textually located deep within a collection of other relatively uncontroversial restrictions, and it almost appeared to be seeking an inconspicuous situs – a place where its message, albeit unambiguous, might be muted by its less provocative neighbors. The covenant was also temporally camouflaged. That is, the exact wording of the covenant was never explicitly repeated after its first inclusion in the original deed out from Greenway in 1942. For the five conveyances that followed the first full expression of the covenant, including the conveyance to the Wares, sellers of the lot recited only that the property was “subject to restrictions of record, a sort of short-hand expression which served only to obscure the existence of all of the A-M covenants, and in particular the textually buried racial restriction of covenant F” (Ware, 2020, p. 4)

- Overall, the "vast majority of Manchester’s developers did NOT use racially restrictive covenants. Data collected from the town’s land records is telling: Out of approximately 100 subdivisions approved in Manchester between roughly 1910 and 1950, only the three mentioned above (i.e. only about 3% of the subdivisions) used such covenants. Out of approximately 7,100 residential building lots represented by those 100 subdivisions, only the 248 lots within Greenway, Lakewood Circle and Bowers (i.e. only about 3.5%) were burdened with covenants that required the exclusion of nonwhites." p15
