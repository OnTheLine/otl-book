# Restrictive covenants TODO


Now we can reasonably estimate that 22 percent (509 out of 2297) of Hamden homes built during the 1940s had racial covenants. See calculations

This is far higher than the 3 to 6 percent rates that Dave and I found in Manchester and West Hartford, respectively, and I'll add this to the book chapter after my CA trip. 

Some Connecticut lakefront cottage areas, such as parts of East Haddam, appear to have high percentages of residences with racist covenants.

## East Haddam lake association notes from Dave Ware
I just spend much of the day in East Haddam.  Bottom line:  that town appears to have at least 5 developments, with a total of more than 1,400 properties ,that are affected by a racially restrictive covenant.  The 5 developments I have identified so far are:

Moodus Estates  (~624 Lots)
Moodus Lake Shores ( ?? Lots)
Shore Acres Park  ((?? Lots)
Carroll Acres  (49 Lots)
Lake Hayward Club Property  (~750 Lots)

This looks like a classic example of the development of lakeshore neighborhoods – many probably used as second homes or vacations spots – where the developers wanted to assure buyers that their neighbors would be only of the Caucasian Race.

Jack, the one deed that you showed us,  which conveys a single lot in “Moodus Estates” – that deed was for the sale of only one of about 624 lots in that subdivision.  The man who signed that deed – Mr. Parker – was also a principle in the subdivision called “Moodus Lake Shores”, which Mr. Parker developed with a partner, Curtis Jones. It appears that both Parker and Jones owned substantial lands in East Haddam, but lived in Washington, D.C.

The maps for “Moodus Lake Shores” and “Shore Acres Park” are a bit hard to read, so I don’t have a good count for the number of lots in those developments right now.  I may need to return to East Haddam.

By the way, many of the deeds for properties in Lake Hayward Club were signed in Florida by  Mr. Avy Smith, the president of Shore and Lake Corp. – the developer of that subdivision.  It seems that both Mr. Smith and Mr. Parker were making enough money on their respective developments to spend their winters in Florida!  With respect to Lake Hayward, I have seen an example of a deed for one of those properties dated as early as 1930 containing the race restriction.

Anyway – some more to do.  Jack I’ll try to send you maps and deeds within a few days..

## 39 Colony Road
Dave
You don't have any obligation to dig into this, but I'm following up on our prior conversation about 39 Colony Road WH, in case it still interests you. If not, I can try to hire a title searcher.
As you recall, Shari Cantor stated in a recent oral history video that the home had a "restrictive covenant and did not allow Jewish people," but I have not yet seen any documents confirming this.
Using the WH online land records in the attached PDF, I have traced the sale of 39 Colony Road back to the Henry S Robinson Jr. estate in 1987. There are other clues on the PDF about possible prior sales to him, but I can't identify which of these is 39 Colony Road from the online index, so the rest needs to be done in the property records room. -- SEE PDF in otl-covenants wh-leads

WH Mayor Shari Cantor interview excerpt transcript in @napervilleheritagesocietyWestHartfordConnecticut2022
she recalls a "restrictive covenant" but so far we have not found one; keep looking?
on moving (notes supplemented with WH property records)
(1985 name changed from Shari J. Granow to Shari G Cantor)
(1985 mortgage with Michael Cantor at 147-149 Dover Road)
(1991 moved w Michael to 19 Foxcroft Road)
(2008 moved to 39 Colony Road)
"We lived in a two-family house and we bought on Foxcroft Road. And then when our youngest son was in sixth grade, we moved to, the sort of the Hartford Golf Club area, **which actually had a restrictive covenant** and did not allow Jewish people. And now I think on our street, there are four or five houses that have Jewish owners. And so it's interesting that Jews were not allowed in that area, and there's a strong Jewish presence there now. Our two-family house was on Dover Road and we actually sold that home to HUD for affordable housing. And then we purchased our house on Foxcroft. And no it was not a Jewish neighborhood and that was something that actually I wanted for my children to not live in a Jewish neighborhood, but have Jewish education and understand their roots and the ethics and the culture. But no, that was not. That was something that we were actually looking to... And the traditional Jewish neighborhoods, many of the houses, a lot of people have wonderfully survived for years. As I said about, you know, our neighbor who was a Holocaust survivor. Many stayed in their homes. So there were a lot of older people in homes and we wanted to be in a younger neighborhood. And so that also made a difference."

** See also how Tracey Wilson wrote about Shari Cantor's experience in this article, but does not refer to a restrictive covenant. Instead, Tracy writes:
By contrast, Shari Cantor, West Hartford’s current mayor and a resident on Colony Road since 2009, and others from the neighborhood say that Jews were excluded from buying on that street for many decades after the ample Tudor homes were built in 1929 and 1930. A look at the names from the city directory in 1958 supports this assertion.

## 19 Foxcroft Road
Instead of 39 Colony Road, what if Shari Cantor had a restrictive covenant on her prior home at 19 Foxcroft?
built in 1926, but I can only trace online land records back to 30 Aug 1974, Walter and Anna Twomey, book 529, p 636. Asked Dave Ware to follow up on paper.

2021 Email with Ali Oshinskie
Thanks for recommending further investigation of 68 Foxcroft Road
When my students and I researched restrictive covenants in West Hartford town records years ago, we looked at several addresses on Foxcroft to attempt to verify these oral accounts as told to Tracey Wilson:
By word of mouth I had heard that in the 1930s and 1940s and into the 1950s, no Roman Catholics could live on Stoner Drive, the first street developed on “the mountain.” No Catholics could buy on Wood Pond or Sunset Farms or West Hill or Sunnyreach. According to another resident, the address of a house on the corner of Foxcroft Road and Fern Street was changed to Fern Street because no Jews were allowed on Foxcroft Rd. But how many of these restrictions actually appear in West Hartford in writing and on legal documents? They have been hard to find in writing.

We did not find anything on Foxcroft Road at that time, but I’ll add it to my list of addresses to check again when Town Hall opens up again.

Thanks for the time today!
Sorry we had to hop off quickly, thanks for the time. I'll get to some sleuthing and also be in touch with some Waterbury historians. I'll let you know if I find anything.
The address I mentioned is 68 Foxcroft Road. I think you'll find it a little tricky because I think she told me they pieced together a few properties to create that larger than after one at some point.
Thanks again,
Ali
