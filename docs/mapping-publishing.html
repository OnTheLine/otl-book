<p>This chapter details our design process and web technologies we used to create this open-access digital book. Our interactive web maps, built with open-source Leaflet code, help broader audiences to visualize spatial and historical change over time. The chapter also describes our publishing workflow, based on the open-source Bookdown package for RStudio, which produces both HTML web pages and PDF print pages. We share our knowledge about these tools so that others may innovate and build more digital books to tell their own stories.</p>

<h2>A Digital History Dialogue</h2>
<p><em>by <a href="index.html#authors-and-contributors">Jack Dougherty</a> with editors of The Metropole blog of the Urban History Association</em></p>
<p><em>The editors of the “Digital Summer School” series of <a href="https://themetropole.blog">The Metropole</a>, the official blog of the Urban History Association, invited me to dialogue with them about the process of creating On The Line, and gave me permission to republish the essay and add footnotes.</em><span class="citation"><a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a></span></p>

<h4>Digital Summer School: On The Line in Metropolitan Hartford, Connecticut</h4>
<p>This is the second installment in our annual Digital Summer School series which highlights digital humanities projects focusing on urban history…</p>
<p>Featured Project: Jack Dougherty, On the Line: How Schooling, Housing, and Civil Rights Shaped Hartford and its Suburbs</p>
<div id="why-did-you-establish-this-digital-project-meaning-why-a-digital-book-rather-than-your-more-traditional-academic-text-who-do-you-see-as-its-audience-and-why" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Why did you establish this digital project, meaning why a digital book rather than your more traditional academic text? Who do you see as its audience and why?</h5>
<p>Many historians have a bad habit of splitting our work into separate categories, such as “digital projects” versus “scholarly books.” Some institutional factors feed this division, such as revenue-driven publishers (who depend on book sales) and conventional tenure committees (who cannot imagine how to evaluate digital projects). But this false dichotomy between projects and books does not serve our broader interests as academic authors. In our field of history, as the average scholarly monograph sells only a few hundred copies, and the retail price tag approaches $50 per copy or higher, our audience is increasingly likely to search on the web for historical sources and interpretation, and to view these results in their browsers. In today’s digital context, dividing projects and books is not a viable path; we need options to merge them into one.</p>
<p>Kristen Nawrotzki and I made this general argument in our introduction to <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1030699">Writing History in the Digital Age</a>. Over twenty-five contributors and our publisher, the University of Michigan Press, agreed to share our peer-reviewed publication under an open-access license, where readers can discover and view the full-text book on the web (for free) or in print (for a reasonable price). Scholars holding full-time jobs in academic institutions operate primarily in a reputation-based economy. If readers can access our ideas with our names attached and determine them to be of high-quality, then our value goes up. By contrast, if our ideas are locked inside hard-to-access books or behind paywalls, regardless of their quality, our reputations among readers will suffer. My thinking about these issues continued to evolve, and I experimented further with blending web technology and book production, as I co-edited a second open-access book, with Tennyson O’Donnell, <a href="http://webwriting.trincoll.edu">Web Writing</a>, and launched an open-access textbook with Ilya Ilyankou, <a href="http://datavizforall.org">Data Visualization for All</a> (in-progress).<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a></p>
<p>These three works illustrate lessons I learned while working on my current book, <em><a href="http://ontheline.trincoll.edu">On The Line: How Schooling, Housing, and Civil Rights Shaped Hartford and its Suburbs</a></em> (in-progress, under contract with Amherst College Press). Set in Connecticut’s capital region, the book makes visible the hidden boundaries that have divided American cities and suburbs over the past century, as well as the civil rights struggles of families and activists who crossed over, redrew, or erased these powerful lines. As a work of history, <em>On The Line</em> blends textual narrative and digital sources into one book, with web and print editions. Perhaps it’s most appropriate to call it a digital-first book, because the richest edition is the one that appears on the open web. The narrative is wrapped around digital evidence—including interactive maps, oral history audio and video, and scanned documents—to make racial and class boundaries visible to broader audiences and to amplify the voices of people who challenged these lines.</p>

<h5>How did this project come to fruition? What obstacles did you have to overcome?</h5>
<p>Thanks to the wonderful <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Way Back Machine</a> by the Internet Archive, I took another look at the first version of <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100614053219/http://ontheline.trincoll.edu/">On The Line that I published on the public web in 2010</a></em>. At that very early stage, I presented some dreams and demos to obtain grant funding and naively predicted to finish everything by 2012 (Ha!) This early version also reminded me that my previous publishing partner insisted I create two interconnected yet separate products—a digital repository (free) and a scholarly book (for sale)—each designed to stand alone, but to refer readers back and forth. Under this early model, readers would have to buy or borrow the book to read the text and go to the companion website to explore the interactive maps, videos, and other digital elements. Honestly, I’m glad that I didn’t finish on my initial deadline, under the restrictive terms of this proposed publishing arrangement, since the final product would have been disappointingly fragmented.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a></p>
<p>The truth is that the origins of <em>On The Line</em> can be traced back to my personal frustration with the status quo of scholarly communication. “Why separate the digital project and the book?” I recall asking. “Why not create a better book that unifies text and sources into one product?” I began exploring open-source digital tools that merged web and PDF publishing into one workflow. First the <a href="http://anthologize.org/">Anthologize</a> WordPress beta plugin (by the One Week One Tool team at the Center for History and New Media, George Mason University), then the Pressbooks/Open Textbook/WordPress plugin platform (by <a href="https://pressbooks.com/">PressBooks</a> and <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/">BC Campus</a>), and now I use the <a href="https://bookdown.org/">Bookdown</a> package (by RStudio). Each step has brought me closer to an improved workflow: composing easy-to-edit text that cleanly produces a web edition, with embedded interactive maps and videos, and a PDF edition, with static screenshots and links to interactive web content. Fortunately, I work with a supportive group of current and former students, librarians, and IT staff, because building an ambitious digital-first book like this one involves many steps: designing and coding interactive historical maps; transcribing and hosting oral history audio and video; managing citations and external links; future-proofing; and embedding all of this content into web and print formats. I’m not a speedy writer, and managing all of these steps has slowed me down even further.</p>

<h5>On a purely functional level, when considering the project’s internal structure, how did you think about incorporating aspects of <em>On the Line</em> such as its interactive maps, videos, and other features?</h5>
<p>As a historian, my job is to tell meaningful true stories about the past. For this book in particular, the goal is to help readers see the “invisible” race and class boundary lines that have increasingly divided city and suburban residents over time, and to draw attention to the ways that families and activists sought to cross over or erase lines, such as movements for school integration and inclusionary zoning. Showing how these people tell their own civil rights stories in oral history video clips is more powerful than merely retelling their stories in the text. While working on each chapter, often with student co-authors, we continually ask these types of questions: <em>How can we tell stories that connect with our present-day readers? How can we persuade readers to explore and accept our interpretation of the evidence? And how can we guide both local and distant readers through spatial and historical change in our place-based narrative of a central city and its diverging suburbs?</em> Creating this type of book requires traditional research and writing, but also dreaming up digital sources – interactive maps, video clips, and digitized documents – to embed into the narrative and illustrate our analysis. Some of my best teachers in this genre have been digital journalists (such as <a href="http://alvinschang.com/">Alvin Chang</a>, formerly at CTMirror.org, now at Vox.com).</p>
<p>For example, consider how historians have published over time about “redlining,” or discrimination in financial services based on people’s residence, typically linked to their race or ethnicity. Ken Jackson’s book, <em>Crabgrass Frontier</em> (1985), introduced many readers to the 1930s Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) and their color-coded neighborhood appraisal maps, which he quoted from and included an image of to demonstrate their segregative intent. Subsequent scholars such as <a href="http://doi.org/10.1177/0096144203029004002">Amy Hillier</a> (2003) analyzed archival records with spatial computing methods and questioned whether actual HOLC lending practices matched this intent. A decade later, historians Robert K. Nelson, LaDale Winling, Richard Marciano, Nathan Connolly and their colleagues released their <em><a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/">Mapping Inequality</a></em> digital history project (2016), with its impressive compilation of over 150 HOLC maps and appraisals, with commentary. In <em>On The Line</em>, former student Sean McGann and I <a href="https://ontheline.trincoll.edu/separating.html#federal-lending-and-redlining">co-authored a chapter</a> that interprets this redlining history with a Hartford-area narrative. The chapter is illustrated with an interactive map of neighborhood appraisals created with the Map and Geographic Information Center (MAGIC) at University of Connecticut Libraries and the assistance of Trinity College graduate Ilya Ilyankou. The eye-catching redlining maps pull local readers further into the <em>On The Line</em> narrative, and allow them to explore archival documents for specific neighborhoods. But our book also argues that other federal programs,such as the Underwriting Manuals of the Federal Housing Administration, which are not as visually attractive as the HOLC maps, may have been more influential in segregating suburbs. Overall, this digital-first book delivers a hybrid combination of textual interpretation and interactive sources that, in my view, is vastly superior to the alternative: a separate book and web site.</p>

<h5>What role do digital projects like <em>On the Line</em> play in the field of history? Where do you see this project and others like it going in the future?</h5>
<p>Based on local feedback, I know that <em>On The Line</em> has already begun to achieve one of its primary goals for Hartford-area audiences: to educate residents on ways that housing and education barriers have shaped our city and suburbs, and about the strategies used by activists and families who fought back against them. Although it’s still a book-in-progress, my student co-authors and I are publishing chapters and sources, as we complete them, on the open web. Our analytics tell us that thousands of readers have discovered this history, and dozens of local organizations and schools have invited us to give public presentations. Not bad for a not-yet-finished book.</p>
<p>As for the broader historical profession, another goal is for <em>On The Line</em> to help change the way we envision scholarly communication, by offering a reproducible example of blending textual narrative and digital sources into a book with both web and print editions. But I don’t have much evidence of progress to share. Look again at the wording of the question above, which refers to <em>On The Line</em> as a “digital project” rather than a “book.” It’s surprising to me how slowly the historical profession is creeping into the digital age, while keeping its traditional publishing paradigms intact. Relatively few historians appear to be writing digital-first books that genuinely blend textual narrative and digitized sources. I fully realize that these types of books require more work by collaborative teams, not just individual scholars; a wider range of skills not typically taught in history graduate schools; and sources of both start-up and sustainable funding. When I began work on this nearly a decade ago, I sincerely believed that more historians would be moving in this direction. Yet it still feels lonely to me. (While typing these words, I secretly hope to hear back from readers who will prove me wrong and share links to other digital-first books that blend text and evidence.)</p>

<h5>It seems over the past few years two aspects of urban history have arisen 1) greater emphasis placed on education as key factor in suburban development notably in the case of your work here and others such as Ansley Erickson and 2) efforts by more academic and popular historians (I’m thinking of perhaps Richard Rothstein’s The Color of Law which fundamentally synthesized a large body of work) to really grapple with how suburbs and their attendant segregation came to be. How do you explain these developments which in many ways are embodied by the project itself?</h5>
<p>Yes, I’ve been very impressed by recent works on the historical relationship between housing and education, such as Ansley Erickson’s <em><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1008906572">Making the Unequal Metropolis</a></em> (2016), Richard Rothstein’s <em><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/959808903">The Color of Law</a></em> (2017), and others. This may be a case where historians are just now catching up with our audiences. For several decades, privileged Americans and our politicians have understood the growing two-way equation between housing and schooling: where you live shapes your children’s education, and their level of education shapes their future income and where they can afford to live. So why has it taken historians so many decades to write about this?</p>
<p>The “<a href="https://ontheline.trincoll.edu/introduction.html#bridging-the-history-gap">Bridging the History Gap</a>” section of <em>On The Line</em> argues that we have not fully understood how this dynamic relationship between housing and schooling played a central role in shaping metropolitan America because a prior generation of historians split these topics into separate bodies of literature and essentially drew boundaries around these disciplinary subfields. On one side of this scholarly divide, urban and suburban historians, such as Arnold Hirsch, <em>Making the Second Ghetto</em>, and Ken Jackson, <em>Crabgrass Frontier</em>, described how housing policies and racial discrimination fueled the post-World War II decline of cities and expansion of outlying suburbs, but schools did not play a meaningful role in their equation. On one side, educational historians who followed the lead of David Tyack (<em>The One Best System</em>) focused on the rise and fall of big-city school districts, yet paid little attention to their relationship with suburbs. Whereas most educational historians halted at the city line, urban and suburban historians generally stopped at the schoolhouse door. So it’s a refreshing development to see newer historical works by Ansley Erickson, Matthew Lassiter, and others blur these boundaries.</p>

<h5>So far, what moment or event related to your digital project comes to mind when I say greatest achievement or unique insight?</h5>
<p>Years ago, when teaching or presenting about the history of cities, suburbs, and schools, I used to “talk with my hands,” waving them around in the air in my feeble attempt to visually represent racial and economic change across neighborhoods over time. Now I teach and give talks with interactive historical maps. Seems to be a much better way to communicate about urban history, and less annoying for the audience.</p>

<h2>Building with Bookdown, GitHub, and Zotero</h2>
<p><em>by <a href="index.html#authors-and-contributors">Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou</a></em></p>
<p>We are building this open-access book with open-source tools—namely Bookdown, GitHub, and Zotero—and openly sharing the knowledge we acquire so that others may improve on the process. We welcome feedback from digitally-minded authors and software developers on <a href="https://twitter.com/doughertyjack">Twitter</a> or directly on the GitHub repo for this page <a href="https://github.com/OnTheLine/otl-bookdown/blob/master/09.3-bookdown.Rmd" class="uri">https://github.com/OnTheLine/otl-bookdown/blob/master/09.3-bookdown.Rmd</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bookdown.org">Bookdown</a>, an open-source software package by Yihui Xie at RStudio, allows authors to compose in version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, an easy-to-read-and-write cross-platform syntax, and create one workflow that produces books in multiple formats, such as Web edition, PDF edition, ePUB ebook edition, and Microsoft Word. Furthermore, Bookdown generates the Web edition as a set of static-site HTML files, which display digital elements (such as interactive maps and videos) and load very quickly into readers’ web browsers. Individual authors can install Bookdown on their Mac, Windows, or Linux computers, and publish their work through a free and simple GitHub Pages account, rather than a separate and complex web server. Interestingly, Bookdown requires installing the open-source <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R Project</a> and <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio console and editor</a>, which typically are used for statistical data analysis. Behind the scenes, Bookdown converts the text of the book from R-flavored Markdown files into Web and eBook editions using <a href="https://pandoc.org/">PanDoc</a>, an open-source universal document converter, without requiring authors to learn complex Pandoc instructions. Although Bookdown may not be the best choice for novice computer users, installation steps are outlined below, along with a recommended workflow for authoring and publishing with GitHub and Zotero.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> is an open-source repository that enables us to publicly share the text and code in this book, with a version-control system that allows collaborators to work on different sections at the same time. Also, the <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> feature allows us to freely host online all of the book editions (Web, PDF, etc.), with a custom domain name purchased through another service, <a href="http://reclaimhosting.com">Reclaim Hosting</a>. As this is an open-access publication, we intentionally make its contents public—and also share instructions like this—while we work on the book, which is consistent with the contract signed with our open-access publisher. Note that GitHub also allows users the option to make repositories private.</li>
<li><a href="http://zotero.org">Zotero</a> is an open-source bibliography manager to collect sources and organize citations, created by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. <a href="https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex">Better BibTeX</a> is an extension by Emiliano Heynes that makes Zotero citation keys work better with Markdown text workflows. While Bookdown does not require using Zotero, scholars who need to manage multiple source materials and citations will benefit from the Bookdown—Zotero—Better BibTeX workflow described below.</li>

<div id="alternative-tools-to-consider" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Alternative Tools to Consider</h4>
<p>Before leaping into any software platform, consider the costs and benefits of using that tool to achieve your goal, such as writing and publishing a web-and-print book like this one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Conventional word processors: Most authors work primarily with text, and are content with a traditional book-publishing workflow that begins with composing in Microsoft Word or LibreOffice, then handing it off to a publisher for review, copyediting, layout, and distribution. But this book is designed to blend text and digital media (such as interactive maps, video clips, scanned documents, and links) and publishing the book in two formats: on the public web (for free) and an inexpensive paperback (for sale). Traditional word processors do not achieve this goal.</li>
<li>Sophisticated word processors: <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener">Scrivener</a> by Literature &amp; Latte is a powerful word-processor and outlining tool designed to help authors see both “the forest or the trees” of book-length manuscripts. In fact, the first few chapters of this <em>On The Line</em> book were initially composed in Scrivener. Although Scrivener supports a different version of Markdown, the tool was not designed to integrate interactive maps and charts into text, nor does it support multi-author collaboration or sharing files on a public repository.</li>
<li>Cloud-based word processors: Some authors realize the benefits of writing collaboratively or sharing drafts in public or semi-public venues for early feedback. One way to attain these benefits with little investment of technology and time is to compose chapters of a book in <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Documents</a> or similar cloud-based word-processors. In fact, some text of chapters for this book were collaboratively composed and edited in Google Docs, then converted to Markdown format using a Google add-on tool, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/docs-to-markdown/igffnbdfnodiaphfmfaiiaegmoljbghf?utm_source=permalink">Docs to Markdown</a> by ed.bacher, and migrated to Bookdown. Although Google Documents can display static images of interactive maps and videos, with links to live online versions, it was not designed to publish book-length editions for the web or PDF.</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress.org</a> is an open-source web authoring platform, used by over 33 percent of the top 10 million websites as of 2019. Users can create a free account on <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a>, or freely download the WordPress software and run a self-hosted version on a server, which requires developer skills or a third-party service, such as <a href="http://reclaimhosting.com">ReclaimHosting.com</a>. Although WordPress creates web pages, it was not designed to produce PDFs or print books. An earlier version of this <em>On The Line</em> book was hosted on a WordPress site from its inception in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100614053219/http://ontheline.trincoll.edu/">2010</a> until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229115227/http://ontheline.trincoll.edu/">2014</a>, as shown in these links to the Internet Archive.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a></li>
<li><a href="http://pressbooks.com">Pressbooks</a> is an open-book publishing platform built on an open-source variation of WordPress Multisite, which produces books in different formats: web, print (PDF), ebooks (ePUB), etc. Authors can pay to publish on the Pressbooks.com platform or a third-party service such as <a href="http://reclaimhosting.com">ReclaimHosting.com</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/pressbooks">freely download the software</a> to run on a server, which requires developer skills. Although Pressbooks is a powerful tool, it requires an investment of time and resources to install and maintain its platform, dependencies, and updates. Also, creating a book in Pressbooks requires authors to compose directly in the WordPress-style editor, or copy-and-paste content from word processor to web platform. The latter workflow is better for authors who wish to easily see and edit across all of their chapters, but requires continually updating back-and-forth between the word processor and web platform to keep both versions identical. An earlier version of the <em>On The Line</em> book-in-progress existed on a self-hosted Pressbooks server at Trinfo.Cafe at Trinity College from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612122023/http://epress.trincoll.edu/ontheline2015/">2015</a> until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170712062322/http://ontheline.trincoll.edu/book/">2017</a>, as shown in these links to the Internet Archive. While the digital and print versions looked great, maintaining the self-hosted Pressbooks site was a chore, and continually moving back-and-forth between the word processor and web platform versions was not ideal. Composing in Bookdown was simpler because there was only one version of the book: the word processor and web platform are the same.</li>
<li><a href="https://scalar.me/">Scalar</a> is an open-source scholarly authoring and publishing platform by the Alliance for Networking Visual Culture, with support from the Mellon Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The platform was created primarily for authors to assemble born-digital book-length works online, with media from multiple sources, and it allows multi-author collaboration. But the platform was not designed to produce PDFs or print books, so was not considered for this book. See examples of online-only works at <a href="https://scalar.me/anvc/scalar/showcase/" class="uri">https://scalar.me/anvc/scalar/showcase/</a>. Users can freely register to create works on the Scalar platform hosted by the University of Southern California at <a href="http://scalar.usc.edu/works/" class="uri">http://scalar.usc.edu/works/</a>, or</li>
<li><a href="https://manifoldapp.org">Manifold</a> is an open-source scholarly publishing platform created through a collaboration by the University of Minnesota Press, the Graduate Center at the City University of New York, and Cast Iron Coding, with funding from the Mellon Foundation. The platform was designed primarily for authors to integrate digital media into their texts, and also for readers to view and annotate drafts and finished books online. It appears that print book production is handled separately. Since installing Manifold on a server requires developer skills, most authors will submit text and media to be uploaded to a server hosted by a publisher or other organization. For example, see Manifold-produced books on the University of Minneapolis Press server at <a href="https://manifold.umn.edu" class="uri">https://manifold.umn.edu</a>. Since the Manifold platform can ingest texts written in Markdown, Microsoft Word, and other formats, it should be feasible to upload a manuscript that was originally produced in Bookdown.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fulcrum.org/">Fulcrum</a> is an open-source scholarly publishing platform created University of Michigan Library and Press working with partners from Indiana, Minnesota, Northwestern, and Penn State universities, with initial funding from the Mellon Foundation. The platform was designed primarily for authors to add or integrate digital media into their works, and for readers to view finished books online. It also appears that print book production is handled separately. Since installing Fulcrum on a server requires developer skills, most authors will submit text and media to be uploaded to a server hosted by a publisher or other organization. For example, see Fulcrum-produced books on the University of Michigan Press server at <a href="https://www.fulcrum.org/michigan" class="uri">https://www.fulcrum.org/michigan</a>, and note that only a portion of these are open-access books. Current documentation does not clearly explain formats authors can submit for Fulcrum to ingest.</li>

<div id="install-bookdown-with-r-rstudio-and-a-latex-engine" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Install Bookdown with R, RStudio, and a LaTex Engine</h4>
<p>Below are steps we followed to setup the publishing platform for this book, using our Macintosh OS 10.14 computers. The same general principles also should apply to Windows computers. No special knowledge is required, but this may not be recommended for novice computer users. Installation steps—and inevitable problems that pop up—will be easier if users are willing to feel adventurous with their computers, or already have some familiarity with text editors, GitHub, or R Studio.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install R Project statistical programming language <a href="https://www.r-project.org" class="uri">https://www.r-project.org</a>, which Bookdown requires. <a href="images/bookdown/1-r-download.png">See screenshot</a></li>
<li>Install the free RStudio Desktop to make R easier to use with a visual editor. <a href="images/bookdown/2-download-rstudio.png">See screenshot</a></li>
<li>Inside RStudio, select the Packages tab, and select Install. <a href="images/bookdown/3-packages-install.png">See screenshot</a></li>
<li>Inside RStudio, install the “bookdown” package to build your book, and select Install Dependencies. <a href="images/bookdown/4-install-bookdown.png">See screenshot</a></li>
<li>Bookdown now should be successfully installed in RStudio. <a href="images/bookdown/5-installed.png">See screenshot</a></li>
<li>For Bookdown to create a PDF edition of your book, you need to install a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> engine to prepare your Markdown plain text, citations, and images into stylized pages. Since the full-sized <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/get/">LaTeX project</a> is very large, Bookdown recommends the smaller TinyTeX package. Inside RStudio, select the Packages tab, select Install, and enter “tinytex” to find and upload the package. <a href="images/bookdown/6-install-tinytex.png">See screenshot</a></li>
<li>To finish the installation, in the RStudio console, type <code>tinytex::install_tinytex()</code> and press return. <a href="images/bookdown/7-finish-install-tinytex.png">See screenshot</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="sidenote-about-the-pdf-edition-and-tinytex-vs-xelatex" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Sidenote: About the PDF edition, and TinyTeX vs XelaTex</h5>
<p>The PDF edition of this Bookdown-generated publication is still a work-in-progress, and the settings are not yet finalized. Read more about various options at <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html</a>. To avoid some unicode error messages when generating the PDF edition for this book, we installed XelaTex instead of TinyTeX. If you do the same, be sure to modify this line in your Bookdown index.Rmd settings: <code>latex_engine: xelatex</code></p>
</div>
<div id="sidenote-if-tinytex-installation-error" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Sidenote: If TinyTeX installation error</h5>
<ul>
<li>Once upon a time, we received this error message when attempting to install tinytex in RStudio on our Mac: <code>/usr/local/bin not writeable</code>. We resolved by reading the software developer’s GitHub issue <a href="https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/issues/24" class="uri">https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/issues/24</a> and following these steps:</li>
<li>In the Mac Applications &gt; Utilities folder, open the Terminal application.</li>
<li>Carefully type <code>sudo chown -R</code>whoami<code>:admin /usr/local/bin</code> and press return.</li>
<li>Carefully type (without “sudo”) <code>~/Library/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin/tlmgr path add</code> and press return.</li>
<li>Close the Terminal application.</li>

<div id="download-and-build-a-sample-bookdown-book" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Download and Build a Sample Bookdown Book</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a free GitHub account <a href="https://github.com" class="uri">https://github.com</a> to simplify steps for the next two sections. While Bookdown does not require you to use GitHub, the workflow described below features GitHub to copy a Bookdown template and to host your own Bookdown editions online.</li>
<li>In your web browser, log into your GitHub account, go to the Bookdown developer’s <code>bookdown-minimal</code> repo <a href="https://github.com/yihui/bookdown-minimal" class="uri">https://github.com/yihui/bookdown-minimal</a>, and fork a copy to your GitHub account. To learn about forking in GitHub, see this chapter <a href="http://datavizforall.org/github.html" class="uri">http://datavizforall.org/github.html</a> in the <em>Data Visualization for All</em> book.</li>
<li>Install GitHub Desktop <a href="https://desktop.github.com" class="uri">https://desktop.github.com</a> to transfer files between your online GitHub repo and local computer. While software developers may prefer to access GitHub by typing commands in their terminal, GitHub Desktop provides easier point-and-click access for most users.</li>
<li>In your web browser, go to your forked copy of <code>bookdown-minimal</code>, click the green <code>Clone or Download</code> button, and select <code>Open in Desktop</code>. This should automatically open the GitHub Desktop application, and you can navigate where you wish to store a copy of your code repo on a folder in your local computer.</li>
<li>In RStudio in the upper-right corner, select Project &gt; Open Project to open the <code>bookdown-minimal</code> folder on your local computer. <a href="images/bookdown/8-project-open.png">See screenshot</a></li>
<li>In RStudio, open the <code>index.Rmd</code> file and make some simple edits to the text of this minimal book. For example, remove the hashtag <code>#</code> comment symbol in line 8 to “uncomment” and activate the PDF book option. Save your edits. <a href="images/bookdown/9-edit-book.png">See screenshot</a></li>
<li>Optional: If you wish, you can modify your <code>bookdown-minimal</code> files outside of RStudio, by using your preferred text editor, such as Atom editor <a href="https://atom.io" class="uri">https://atom.io</a>.</li>
<li>In RStudio, upper-right corner, select the Build tab, select Build Book, and choose All Formats to build both the gitbook-style static web edition and PDF edition.</li>
<li>If RStudio successfully builds both editions of your minimal book, the output will be saved into your <code>bookdown-minimal</code> folder, in a subfolder named <code>_book</code>, because that’s how this sample is configured. The RStudio internal browser should automatically open your web edition (but it’s not a very good browser, so we typically close it and manually open the <code>index.html</code> file with Firefox or Chrome browser.)</li>
<li>Also, open the subfolder and inspect the PDF edition of your book. If RStudio found any errors, they will appear in the Build viewer. <a href="images/bookdown/11-successful-build.png">See screenshot</a></li>
<li>Hint: In future sessions with RStudio, you may need to select Packages tab and click Update to keep bookdown and other software packages up to date. <a href="images/bookdown/12-packages-update.png">See screenshot</a></li>
<li>Close RStudio.</li>
</ul>

<div id="host-your-book-with-github-pages" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Host your Book with GitHub Pages</h4>
<ul>
<li>Open GitHub Desktop and navigate to the <code>bookdown-minimal</code> folder on your local computer. Write a quick summary to commit (or save) the changes you made above to your master branch, and push this version to your online GitHub repo.</li>
<li>In your web browser, go to your online GitHub repo, with a web address similar to <code>https://github.com/USERNAME/bookdown-minimal</code> (insert your own GitHub username).</li>
<li>In your GitHub repo, select Settings, and scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, which is a free web hosting service to publish your code and book editions on the public web. Select Master Branch as your source, and Save.</li>
<li>Scroll down to this section again, and the web address of your published site should appear. Copy this address.</li>
<li>In a new browser tab, paste the web address from above, and at the end add <code>_book/index.html</code> because this sample is configured to store all web and PDF editions in your <code>_book</code> subfolder. Your web address should be similar to: <code>https://USERNAME.github.io/bookdown-minimal/_book/index.html</code></li>
<li>Reminder: You may need to wait up to one minute for edits to your GitHub online repo to appear live at your GitHub Pages web address. Also, after waiting for GitHub Pages to make changes, be sure to “force reload” or “hard refresh” your web browser to update directly from the GitHub Pages server, not the browser’s internal cache. On Mac, press shift + command + R. On Windows, press ctrl + F5.</li>

<p>We changed this Bookdown setting from the default <code>_books</code> folder to the <code>docs</code> folder to take advantage of the GitHub Pages setting that allows hosting online content from the <code>master/docs</code> folder, rather than the entire <code>master</code> branch. Choosing these Bookdown and GitHub Pages settings allows authors to publicly share their book source code and raw text on the <code>master</code> branch, <strong>and</strong> host online the Web and ebook editions from the <code>master/docs</code> subfolder of that branch. (Years earlier, GitHub previously required users to separate these tasks on two different branches, typically called
<code>master</code> and <code>gh-pages</code>, but now users can do both through one branch, which is simpler.) Also, following this <code>master/docs</code> method simplifies the address of your GitHub Pages published web edition to this format: <code>https://USERNAME.github.com/REPONAME</code>. (See further below about customizing the web address.)</p>
<p>In this publication, the <code>index.Rmd</code> file is set to produce the Web edition in the GitBook style, with additional settings explained further below. (Proper indenting is important here.)</p>
<pre><code>output:
  bookdown::gitbook:
    dev: svglite
    css: css/style.css
    includes:
      in_header: [custom-scripts.html, google-analytics-otl.html]
    split_by: chapter
    split_bib: true
    number_sections: true</code></pre>
<p>In the GitHub repo for this publication, the root structure of the files is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapters in RMarkdown format, such as: <code>01-introduction.Rmd</code></li>
<li>Sections inside chapters, such as <code>01.1-section.Rmd</code> and <code>01.2-section.Rmd</code></li>
<li>The <code>images</code> folder, where JPG, PNG, and PDFs to display in chapters are located.</li>
<li>The <code>docs</code> folder, which contains the published book products, such as Web edition (<code>index.html</code>, <code>introduction.html</code>, etc.), the PDF edition (<code>Dougherty-etal-OnTheLine.pdf</code>), etc.</li>
<li>Additional helper files described further below.</li>
</ul>
<p>The setting above to <code>split_by: chapter</code> means that Bookdown merges each parent chapter (<code>01-introduction.Rmd</code>) and its child sections (<code>01.1-section.Rmd</code> and <code>01.2-section.Rmd</code>) into its own web page (<code>introduction.html</code>), and all of the web pages are linked to one another via <code>index.html</code>. This setting allows collaborators to work on individual sections of the book (which are separate files in GitHub), but to display each chapter to the reader as one long web page, rather than shorter separate web pages for each section. Alternatively, authors can change the setting to <code>split_by: section</code> to produce separate web pages for each file.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you revise the names of book chapters, Bookdown builds new HMTL pages based on new names. But old HMTL pages based on old chapter names may still exist in the same subfolder. To avoid confusion, you may wish to carefully delete old HTML pages in <code>docs</code> whenever you significantly reorganize the file structure and build a new version of the book.</li>
<li>In addition, this GitHub Pages repo is published with a custom domain name <a href="https://OnTheLine.trincoll.edu" class="uri">https://OnTheLine.trincoll.edu</a>. Learn more about custom domain names at <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/" class="uri">https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/</a>. Typically, a custom domain name is purchased from a web hosting service, such as <a href="http://reclaimhosting.com">ReclaimHosting</a>, and you may need customer support to access the Manage DNS (domain name system) to point your new URL to your GitHub Pages online site. For this book’s custom domain name, <a href="https://ontheline.trincoll.edu" class="uri">https://ontheline.trincoll.edu</a>, the IT staff at Trinity College created a subdomain on their .edu domain, which shows that my scholarship is affiliated with an academic institution. Adding a GitHub Pages custom domain name creates an additional <code>CNAME</code> file in the <code>docs</code> subfolder. Avoid accidentally erasing the <code>CNAME</code> file if you need to clear out any old HTML files in your subfolder.</li>
<li>The web edition of this book includes two custom files that are referenced in the <code>index.Rmd</code> file header, and are generated into the web edition when building the book:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>output:
  bookdown::gitbook:
    dev: svglite
    css: css/style.css
    includes:
      in_header: [custom-scripts.html, google-analytics-otl.html]</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>the <code>custom-scripts.html</code> file includes specific instructions to set the height or width of iframes for specific interactive maps and charts in the web edition, which is explained further in the Style Guide section of this book. (Thanks to Michael Dorman for this tip.)</li>
<li>the <code>google-analytics-otl.html</code> file records web traffic with Google Analytics, if you create a free account and insert your code.</li>
<li>The web edition of this book also includes a custom <code>404.html</code> file that redirects any bad web addresses under the domain back to <code>index.html</code> page. A copy of this file must be manually transferred into the <code>docs</code> subfolder, because it is not automatically built by Bookdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this publication, the <code>index.Rmd</code> file also contains instructions to create footnotes and a bibliography from a Zotero-Better BibLaTeX exported file named <code>ontheline.bib</code>, in a specific Chicago-style format. Other <code>.csl</code> files are downloadable from the Zotero Styles Repository <a href="https://www.zotero.org/styles" class="uri">https://www.zotero.org/styles</a>.</p>
<pre><code>bibliography: ontheline.bib
citation-style: chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl</code></pre>
<p>Also in this publication, the <code>index.Rmd</code> file is set to produce a PDF edition of the book using the xelatex engine (or see tinytex or latex alternatives described above). Furthermore, additional PanDoc settings are required to create the desired Chicago-style footnotes and bibliography in the PDF edition. See more details at <a href="https://pandoc.org/" class="uri">https://pandoc.org/</a>.</p>
<pre><code>  bookdown::pdf_book:

<div id="zotero-and-better-bibtex-for-footnotes-and-bibliography" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Zotero and Better BibTex for Footnotes and Bibliography</h4>
<p>This workflow uses the open-source Zotero bibliography manager (<a href="http://zotero.org" class="uri">http://zotero.org</a>), with the Better BibTeX extension (<a href="https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/" class="uri">https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/</a>) to work more easily with Markdown and Bookdown. Rather than typing full references directly into the text, authors can insert a short citation key to each source, and the tools will automatically generate the desired references (such as Chicago-style footnotes, which historians love) and an alphabetized bibliography for the book. Furthermore, since authoring this <em>On The Line</em> book has been a multi-year process with multimedia sources whose web addresses have changed over time, this workflow ensures that the most up-to-date information in your Zotero database also appears in all editions of your book.</p>
<p>With these tools installed, here’s an outline of the author’s workflow:
- An entry for each source (book, journal article, document, etc.) must be created in the author’s Zotero library (or a specific collection), either automatically from the web or manually.
- Better BibTex generates a unique citation key for each source (example: <code>^[@tyackOneBestSystem1974]</code>), which authors insert into the Markdown text to create a full reference (such as a footnote) and a bibliography.
- The author identifies their preferred citation style at <a href="https://www.zotero.org/styles" class="uri">https://www.zotero.org/styles</a>, uploads the file (example: chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl) to the local book repo, and lists it in the <code>index.Rmd</code> settings for both the Web edition and the PDF edition.
- Before each build in Bookdown, the author sets their Zotero preferences, and exports the Zotero library or specific collection to the root level of the local book repo (example: ontheline.bib).</p>
<div id="installation-and-settings" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Installation and Settings</h5>
<ul>
<li>Download and install <a href="http://zotero.org">Zotero</a> for Mac, Windows, Linux, and add connectors to your browsers.</li>
<li>Install the <a href="https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/">Better BibTeX extension</a> and follow all of the site’s instructions for initial setup.</li>
<li>At the top of each entry in Zotero, the extension will generate a unique citation code (example: tyackOneBestSystem1974).</li>
<li>You can copy and paste the citation code into your Markdown text, and add a caret, square brackets, and the at symbol <code>^[@tyackOneBestSystem1974]</code>, as described in the Style Guide in this book.)</li>
<li>Also, you can set Zotero preferences &gt; Export &gt; Better BibTeX Quick Copy to use Zotero’s drag-and-drop quick copy feature.</li>
<li>To export a bibliography (.bib) from Zotero library or collection into the local Bookdown repo:
<ul>
<li>Select Library &gt; Right-click to export the collection</li>
<li>Select format &gt; Better BibLaTeX (<em>IMPORTANT</em> I use this setting, rather than “Better BibTex”, because “Better BibLaTex” includes full dates in newspaper citations, and urls). Also, I leave all of the checkboxes blank during the export, and do NOT select “keep updated”. This means that if my Better BibTex citation codes suddenly change in Zotero because the author, title, or year changed, then I’m responsible for running find-and-replace to make these edits in the text of the book.</li>
<li>Save the output as FILENAME.bib, save into your book repo, and be sure to match the settings in <code>index.Rmd</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>These Zotero types appear correctly with this Bookdown workflow:
- Book
- Book chapter
- Journal article
- Newspaper
- Thesis
- Report
- Blog post
- Web page
- Document – Use this all-purpose entry in place of other types: Law case, Presentation, Interview, Video recording, Television broadcast, etc. Insert important details (such as the archival location information) in the Publisher field.</p>
<p>To help other researchers find items cited in this book, URLs should be included in Zotero entries whenever feasible, even if not required by convention. For example, some print-only books and documents are hard to locate, so include an OCLC WorldCat permalink to make them easier to find (example: <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/20683509" class="uri">http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/20683509</a>). Also, if a print source has been digitized by HathiTrust, Google Books, or the Internet Archive, add one of these URLs to the Zotero entry.</p>
<p>Reminder: Chicago full-note works exactly as it was designed, meaning that the second instance of a citation currently appears as an abbreviated note (author, with title when appropriate). TODO: Find or create a modified .CSL file to display the full footnote entry in <em>every</em> instance in the web version, so that users do not need to scroll to find the complete source info.</p>

<h2><em>On The Line</em> Style Guide for Bookdown + RMarkdown</h2>
<p>NOTE: View this file and the code used to create the examples directly on the GitHub repo at <a href="https://github.com/OnTheLine/otl-bookdown/blob/master/09.4-style-guide.Rmd" class="uri">https://github.com/OnTheLine/otl-bookdown/blob/master/09.4-style-guide.Rmd</a>.</p>
<p>Also, this style guide was created primarily for the web edition <a href="http://OnTheLine.trincoll.edu" class="uri">http://OnTheLine.trincoll.edu</a>, and may require additional modifications for the final PDF print edition.</p>
<p>Use HTML-style code comments to insert notes that are invisible to most readers, yet visible to authors (or anyone) viewing the public GitHub repo</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- this comment appears in the source code, but not the book products --&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Use brackets and parentheses for an <a href="http://example.com">embedded link</a></p>
<p>Use parentheses only for a non-embedded link (<a href="http://example.com" class="uri">http://example.com</a>)</p>
<p>Similarly, display URL with angle brackets: <a href="http://example.com" class="uri">http://example.com</a></p>
<p>If necessary, use HTML tags to create <a href="http://example.com/">link that opens in a new page</a></p>
<div id="headers-and-cross-reference-links" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Headers and Cross-reference links</h5>
<p>Use one hashtag for a chapter title (first-level header)</p>
<ul>
<li>Code: <code># Chapter title</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Use two hashtags for a section title (second-level header)</p>
<ul>
<li>Code: <code>## Section title</code></li>
<li><p>Use four or five hashtags, followed by curly brackets, for subheaders in chapters/sections:</p></li>
<li>Code: <code>#### Subheader Inside the Body Text {-}</code></li>
<li><p>code: <code>##### Subheader for Table</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Hide numbers from appearing in section headers with curly brackets around hyphen:</p>
<ul>
<li>code: <code>## Outline of the Book {-}</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this book uses full section references with hidden numbers, because I have not yet found a way to insert a short section reference AND hide its number.</p>
<p>A short chapter title <code># Introduction</code> has a short default reference: <code>#introduction</code>, while a longer chapter title <code># Defining City and Suburban Lines</code> has a longer default reference: <code>#defining-city-and-suburban-lines</code></p>
<p>To simplify long chapter title references, insert a short ID name in curly brackets: <code># Defining City and Suburban Lines {#defining}</code></p>
<p>To embed a cross-reference to a chapter title, add a link using brackets and parentheses:</p>
<ul>
<li>short reference code: <code>*by [Jack Dougherty](index.html#authors-and-contributors)*</code> with demo: <em>by <a href="index.html#authors-and-contributors">Jack Dougherty</a></em></li>
<li>short ID reference code: <code>see chapter [Defining City and Suburban Lines](#defining)</code> with demo: see chapter <a href="defining.html#defining">Defining City and Suburban Lines</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To embed a cross-reference link to a section title (inside a chapter), add a link (to the docs HTML page and section hashtag) using brackets and parentheses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code for contributor: <code>Shaun McGann (Trinity 2014) co-authored [Federal Lending and Redlining](separating.html#federal-lending-and-redlining)</code></li>
<li>Demo for contributor: Shaun McGann (Trinity 2014) co-authored <a href="separating.html#federal-lending-and-redlining">Federal Lending and Redlining</a>.</li>
<li>Code for learn more: <code>in this book about [How We Found Restrictive Covenants](teaching-researching.html#how-we-found-restrictive-covenants)</code></li>
<li>Demo for learn more: in this book about <a href="teaching-researching.html#how-we-found-restrictive-covenants">How We Found Restrictive Covenants</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For an em-dash, use three hyphens—like this—rather than two hyphens.</p>
<p>For a block quote, start each line with a caret <strong>AND</strong> add two spaces to insert a line break:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me, I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him to a quiet place and kill him.<br />
— Mark Twain<br />
— notable American author</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A text-only footnote.<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a></p>
<p>To create a footnote with citations only, separate BibTeX citation keys with semi-colons:<span class="citation"><a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Since footnotes also may include text and punctionation in Markdown syntax, always insert a caret symbol prior to the brackets to demarcate a footnote:<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="subheadings-need-four-hashtags-and-no-number-symbol" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Subheadings need four hashtags and no-number symbol</h4>
<p>Note: Using three hashtags makes the subheader appear in the TOC because I have not found way to control toc_depth in the Web edition. Use the no-number symbol to prevent automatic number of subheaders.</p>
</div>
<div id="figures-interactive-content-and-static-images" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Figures: Interactive Content and Static Images</h4>
<p>In body of the book, avoid inserting images with simple Markdown syntax, because it lacks auto-numbering. Instead, follow this R code chunk method, especially to display interactive content on the HTML web edition, with static screenshot images in the PDF edition:</p>
<div id="overview-of-steps" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Overview of steps</h5>
<ul>
<li>Define a text reference for captions, because this method accepts complex syntax, such as RMarkdown cites and links, as shown below. For details, see Bookdown sections on Figures <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/figures.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/figures.html</a> and Markdown extensions <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html</a>.</li>
<li>Insert a BLANK LINE between the text reference and the R code chunk coming up.</li>
<li>Insert an R code chunk <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/r-code.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/r-code.html</a>, with NO SPACES between ref:chunk-label, as shown below.</li>
<li>To reduce the width (or height) of the output, add <code>out.width=&quot;30%&quot;</code> to the code chunk, which works for Web edition and also PDF edition. If width is less than full, also insert <code>fig.align=&quot;center&quot;</code>.</li>
<li>To display interactive content in the Web edition and a static image in the PDF edition, create both elements and insert an if-else statement in the R code chunk to display these elements in different outputs, as shown below. (Thanks to Michael Dorman for this tip.)</li>
<li>If the interactive content includes an iframe (for a map or chart), the default height will be 400 pixels. To adjust the iframe height (or width), insert a line of code in <code>custom-scripts.html</code> and add a code comment to the text to serve as a reminder, as shown below. Also, make sure that the <code>index.Rmd</code> file includes the custom script in the header, as described in the section above.</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Optional: In the body text, insert a dynamic reference to the figure in the same file, because PDF engine creates floating images that may be placed on the next page. Sample dynamic reference to a figure further below: … as shown in Figure <a href="mapping-publishing.html#fig:sample-interactive">9.3</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reminders:
<ul>
<li>If the image appears a second time in the book, in a separate chapter, be sure to relabel the text ref: year-title2.</li>
<li>Bookdown does not auto-number figures in the index.Rmd file, which serves as a preface or introduction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>STILL TODO
<ul>
<li>Decide if ‘out.width’ and ‘out.height’ is preferable in all cases to <code>&quot;fig_height=7&quot;</code></li>
<li>Accessibility: use alt=&quot;&quot; for brief image description? Or do the detailed captions replace this need?</li>
<li>About auto_pdf: “include_graphics() can be smart enough to use PDF graphics automatically when the output format is LaTeX and the PDF graphics files exist, e.g., an image path foo/bar.png can be automatically replaced with foo/bar.pdf if the latter exists. PDF images often have better qualities than raster images in LaTeX/PDF output. To make use of this feature, set the argument auto_pdf = TRUE, or set the global option options(knitr.graphics.auto_pdf = TRUE) to enable this feature globally in an R session.” from <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/figures.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/figures.html</a></li>

<li>“PDF documents are generated through the LaTeX files generated from R Markdown. A highly surprising fact to LaTeX beginners is that figures float by default: even if you generate a plot in a code chunk on the first page, the whole figure environment may float to the next page. This is just how LaTeX works by default. It has a tendency to float figures to the top or bottom of pages. Although it can be annoying and distracting, we recommend that you refrain from playing the “Whac-A-Mole” game in the beginning of your writing, i.e., desparately trying to position figures “correctly” while they seem to be always dodging you. You may wish to fine-tune the positions once the content is complete using the fig.pos chunk option (e.g., fig.pos = ‘h’). See <a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Positioning_images_and_tables" class="uri">https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Positioning_images_and_tables</a> for possible values of fig.pos and more general tips about this behavior in LaTeX. In short, this can be a difficult problem for PDF output.&quot;</li>
