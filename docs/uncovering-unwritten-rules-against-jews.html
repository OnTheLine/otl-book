<h2>Uncovering Unwritten Rules Against Jews</h2>
<p>Although “unwritten rules” against Jews typically did not appear in public documents, in special cases we can find them in private documents that people believed would remain secret. At Trinity College, Hartford’s preeminent institution of higher education, administrative and student leaders strongly expressed anti-Semitic views and implemented strategies to reduce the number of Jewish students, according to long-hidden minutes of the Board of Trustees meetings from 1915 to 1922. Since these anti-Jewish rules did not appear in any College publications or newspaper accounts from this period, they would be invisible to us today if Trinity’s archivists had not taken made this history public in recent years. Anti-Semitism at Trinity is noteworthy because the Episcopalians who established the College in 1823 directly challenged the lack of religious tolerance in the Congregationalist Church that dominated state government at that time, and adopted a charter that promised Trinity would “not make the religious tenets of any person a condition of admission.”<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Rev. Flavel S. Luther served as President of Trinity College from 1904 to 1919. In public, he was a well-respected mathematician, engineer, and ordained leader in the Episcopalian Church. Hartford voters also elected him to the Connecticut State Senate from 1907 to 1911, where his key accomplishment was to <a href="consolidating.html">consolidate rural school districts and solidify town-level governance</a>. Luther was a Progressive-era Republican who identified with (and bore some resemblance to) former US President Theodore Roosevelt, who accepted his invitation to deliver Trinity’s commencement address in 1918. To this day, a Trinity student tradition is to step on the Luther-Roosevelt commemorative stone only on their graduation day.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>

<p>But behind closed doors, Luther and his contemporaries spoke candidly against Jews. Luther first raised the topic with Trinity’s Board of Trustees in 1915, when he warned them about “the problem presented by the slow, but unmistakable, increase of the number of Jews at the College.” At that time, probably no more than 10 percent of the 250 students on campus were Jewish, most of whom resided in the city of Hartford. “Their presence is resented by the other students and has occasioned many protests by the alumni,” Luther observed, and cautioned that “if they increase, the matter may easily become serious.” Following the Protestant ideology of prior educators, Luther expressed his conviction that Trinity “should do its share in educating these aliens, whatever their race or religion…[because] it is only by education that they can ever be assimilated and Americanized.” Nevertheless, he believed that Jewish student enrollment should be limited in some way because “we cannot afford to sacrifice any of the really higher interests of the college for the sake of a special class.” No objections were recorded among the other fourteen board members in attendance, including distinguished clergymen, bankers, judges, and businessmen. No one mentioned that Trinity’s founders originally established their college on the principles of religious tolerance.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>Although Trinity admitted some Jewish students, the College did not accept Black students at that time. During the same closed-door meeting in 1915, President Luther confided to Board members that he had received several applications from “colored boys who wished to enter Trinity College,” but reported that he found ways to reject all of them. “In each case so far I have been able to avoid an issue by methods which savor somewhat, I fear, of insincerity; but which have been effective.” Perhaps Luther lied to Black applicants about their qualifications, or the finances that would be required, or invented some other reasons why they could not attend Trinity. Looking into the future, he predicted that “the time will come when this matter must be faced and definitely decided.” But that day was in the distant future, because Trinity only admitted a few Black students in the 1950s, and did not begin to address racism in its admissions practices until the late 1960s.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>But Luther accurately predicted that the rising number of Jewish students would soon become a “serious” problem at Trinity College. In April 1918, the Board of Trustees heard from a Student Senate committee, appointed by the faculty “as the result of undergraduate expression of feeling against the Jews.” These five Student Senators, two of whom also led the <em>Trinity Tripod</em> campus newspaper, claimed that the “alarmingly” high rate of Jewish enrollment was approaching 25 percent (although the actual figure was closer to 15 percent). Student Senators’ objections to Jews reflected their negative views of Hartford residents and recent Eastern European immigrants. “The Jews come up to the College from the city, get all they can <em>from</em> from the College, and give nothing <em>to</em> the College,” they wrote. Although Student Senators praised the high scholastic standing of their Jewish peers, they criticized their lack of support for college athletics as well as the war effort. “Speaking in general terms, the Jews have not enlisted in military service while the Gentiles have,” they claimed (a false statement, as documents later showed). Furthermore, the Student Senators complained that “most of the Jews at Trinity are Russian,” which they believed meant that every classroom “has a Russian socialistic expression of opinion.” As a consequence, they told the Board that their classmates “hesitate about showing friends around the College, when they are sure to be greeted frequently by Jews.” Board members asked President Luther to address this problem.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></span></p>

<p>President Luther presented more data and observations about Jewish students at the June 1918 Board meeting, He understood Trinity’s larger problem was that World War I caused total enrollment to fall from around 250 to only 158 students in 1917-18, when many men left college to enlist in military service or join the workforce. The actual number of Jewish students remained relatively stable at 25 that year, but the proportion of Jews on campus had risen to 15 percent. Drawing on his personal observations of student life, Luther pointed to “a few of the Jews in College who, by reason of exceptional personal qualities, are cordially accepted as good fellows. The other students call them ‘White Jews.’” Luther’s comment revealed how Trinity’s dominant White Protestant culture considered most Jews to be <em>non-White</em> in this era, and assigned them to a lower position in the racial hierarchy. Yet while Luther described Jews as “good scholars…who pay their bills,” he concluded that “they are a definite hindrance to the growth of the College,” and suggested ways that Trinity might deter their future enrollment, perhaps by mandatory Christian chapel services for all students.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>One year later, Trinity student leaders continued to demand that the College reduce Jewish enrollments, but now cloaked their anti-Semitism in more publicly acceptable language of the era. The “Student Movement for Americanization at Trinity” submitted its resolutions to the Board of Trustees in April 1919, and demanded a reduction in “the undesirable element,” using this code phrase to replace direct references to “Jews” or “Hebrews.” While Americanization proponents recognized that Trinity’s charter promised equality of opportunity regardless of religion, they argued that “90% of the undesirable element lives in Hartford,” and that the College needed to discourage local Jews from attending Trinity. They proposed a policy of “compulsory residence” in college dormitories “to influence and Americanize all students which cannot be done to some of the students while living at their homes.”<span class="citation"><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Trinity leaders embraced this Americanization strategy. While the College lack sufficient on-campus housing for all students, the Board voted to require dormitory residence for all freshmen and sophomore students “of alien birth, and… whose fathers were of alien birth,” effective Fall 1919. The policy was designed to discourage Hartford Jews from enrolling (since they would have to pay additional residence fees rather than live at home), and to assimilate those who persisted. While Board members debated whether to publish the College’s alien residence rule, it never appeared in public documents such as the Trinity catalogue, student handbooks, or the newspapers. But the policy definitely was implemented, and seemed to meet its objectives. In October 1919, the Board learned that the rule was applied to 16 students, but “only three of these cases were Hebrews.” Furthermore, to avoid creating an undue burden for non-Jewish immigrants, the Board voted to exempt “students of alien parentage residing in other towns than Hartford” from the dormitory residence requirement, at the discretion of administrators. In other words, the son of a Swedish immigrant in West Hartford could attend Trinity while continuing to live at home, but the son of a Jewish immigrant in Hartford could not.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>Two years later, new Trinity President Remsen Ogilby asked the Board to grant him greater discretion over its Americanization policies, but continued to limit the number of Jewish students. In June 1921, Ogilby asked the Board “for a reconsider of the rule requiring sons of foreign born to live on the campus,” and noted that the rule “has caused bitter feelings in some quarters.” Perhaps the alien residence rule was enforced when student applicants listed the nation of birth for themselves and their parents on college forms. Initially, Ogilby seemed to take a stand against treating Jewish students differently. “If the rule is intended to keep out the members of one single race,” he warned, “it is not honest and rules out too many good students who would otherwise be with us.” The Board voted to grant him the power to waive the resident rule on a case-by-case basis. Yet one year later, Ogilby reported on Trinity’s success in reducing its Jewish population. “The number of Jewish students has been a matter of interest to many of us and has concerned two or three,” Ogilby told the Board in 1922, attempting to minimize and put past controversies behind him. He proudly announced that “the percentage of Hebrews in the student body” had declined from 10.5 percent in 1921 to 9 percent in 1922. Ogilby did not emphasize that the number of Jewish students had remained stable at around 25 (roughly the same number as in 1918), but the proportion of Jews fell as the Trinity’s total enrollment rebounded to 268 men after World War I. Ogilby backed off his initial stance against treating Jewish students differently. In 1922, he presented additional suggestions on “limiting the number of Hebrew students” to the Board’s Executive Committee, which they discussed, but without taking action. Unlike wealthier institutions such as Harvard and Yale, Trinity College did not invoke an admissions quota to directly reduce the number of Jewish students. Instead, Trinity relied on the alien residence rule to indirectly discourage Hartford Jews from attending, and to assimilate those who persisted. Since the alien residence requirement was an “unwritten rule” that did not appear in College publications, and did not surface again in Board minutes, we do not know exactly when Trinity stopped enforcing it.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>To be clear, the presence of anti-Semitism at Trinity College does not prove it also motivated West Hartford town official or property owners to oppose Jacob Goldberg’s building permit in 1923. But these documents demonstrate that anti-Semitism was prevalent among Protestant leaders of Hartford’s most-respected institutions—even those that pledged religious tolerance—and that these leaders were highly skilled in hiding their anti-Jewish views and actions from the public eye.</p>
