<h2>Origins of Exclusionary Zoning</h2>
<p>In present-day debates over housing, the phrase <em>exclusionary zoning</em> refers to local government policies that favor the construction of expensive single-family homes on large tracts of land, rather than more affordable multi-family homes on smaller properties, which limits who can afford to live there. In Connecticut, the origins of exclusionary zoning can be traced back to one suburban town’s attempt to block an urban Jewish grocer from building a store in a residential neighborhood in 1924. While this conflict centered around commercial development, it triggered a new phase in ongoing disputes over who controlled real estate, and the legal tools that property owners and local governments used to separate themselves from people they deemed as undesirable neighbors. Unlike other discriminatory barriers of this era—such as <a href="lending.html">mortgage redlining</a> and <a href="restricting.html">restrictive covenants</a>—exclusionary zoning did not directly refer to race or religion. Instead, zoning policies cleverly carved up suburban neighborhoods with minimum home-size and property-size requirements that segregated residents by access to wealth. In this way, exclusionary zoning became a more sophisticated and so-called “color-blind” tool of housing discrimination that largely resisted fair-housing legislation of the 1960s-70s civil rights era, and continues to divide Connecticut into the present day.</p>
<p>When Jacob Solomon Goldberg returned home to Hartford after military service in World War I, he sought to advance himself from a butcher into a businessman. Jacob partnered with his brother Barney and their brother-in-law Hyman M. Cohen to buy a small grocery store in downtown Hartford, near their East Side neighborhood, which they managed together during the early 1920s. Like other entrepreneurs of their era, they “followed the trend of business to the west” and dreamed of opening a second grocery store in the rapidly-growing suburb of West Hartford. The town’s population grew at a faster rate than Hartford during the 1910s and nearly doubled in size to almost 9,000 residents. West Hartford town officials granted more than 300 building permits for single- and two-family homes in 1922, more than any other town in Connecticut that year. Linked by convenient trolley lines to the capital city and corporate headquarters for the nation’s leading banks and insurance companies, West Hartford was quickly becoming an ideal destination for the rising middle class.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>Goldberg searched for the perfect location to open a second grocery store. He bought two parcels of undeveloped land on Farmington Avenue at the corner of Ardmore Avenue, on the trolley line about halfway between the Hartford boundary line and West Hartford’s town center. In the early 1920s, only a dozen grocers served the entire town, including several small shops that sold food products out of their homes. Nearby customers made frequent purchases during the week due to the lack of transportation and refrigeration. The closest competitors were located about a half-mile in opposite directions: West Hill Grocery (also on Farmington Avenue, closer to the Hartford border) and M.J. Burnham’s (a larger store in West Hartford Center). Although the immediate area around Goldberg’s property had only 60 houses in 1923, real estate developers and town officials had subdivided the land into smaller lots, and were building side streets and sewer lines, in anticipation of many more homebuyers. Next door to Goldberg’s vacant lots stood the only non-residential building in the vicinity: the West Hartford Armory for the Connecticut National Guard Troop B Cavalry. Perhaps the odor from its horse stables explained why no one had yet built a home on adjacent property purchased by Goldberg.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>But when Goldberg applied for a building permit in January 1923, the West Hartford building inspector objected. Instead, the inspector called a public hearing, where “a score of property owners in the Ardmore road section appeared and protested” against Goldberg’s plan to build a grocery in what the newspaper described as “one of West Hartford’s exclusive residential sections.” To them, it made no difference that Goldberg had followed all of the legal procedures and hired a respected local architect, William T. Marchant, to design the store to conform with the town’s building code. The proposed store would measure 80 x 60 feet, which would be larger than houses on adjacent side streets, but far smaller than the West Hartford Armory next door that also faced Farmington Avenue, as shown in Figure <a href="origins-zoning.html#fig:otl-ardmore-1923">2.17</a>. Property owners challenged Goldberg’s right to build a store in <em>their</em> neighborhood, and the town government refused to grant him a permit.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

Although Goldberg eventually prevailed and later opened Kingswood Market, this dispute motivated West Hartford to become the first municipality in Connecticut to adopt a zoning policy in 1924.

<h3>More to come, based on rough notes below</h3>
<p>During the 1920s, several states granted local governments a new policy tool—known as municipal zoning—to exert greater control over land development. But tools can be used to achieve different goals. We can use them to help people or cause harm. Evaluating the history of zoning requires a closer look at how local governments implemented this policy, and to what ends.</p>
<p>Progressive advocates saw zoning as a necessary tool for government to regulate the free market and to protect the health and safety of its citizens. For example, zoning gave municipalities the power to draw lines on the land and create separate spaces for residential, commercial, and industrial development. Family homes could be legally separated from potentially harmful businesses or factories. When the Connecticut General Assembly approved zoning enabling law in 1923, it stated that local regulations should be designed for this purpose: “… to prevent a close arrangement or constructions of buildings upon the streets, to secure safety from fire and other dangers, to avoid undue concentration of population and to provide health, comfort and general welfare in living and working conditions.”<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>But local governments often crafted zoning ordinances to achieve other, less innocent goals. Some wrote local ordinances that made housing construction in selected neighborhoods affordable only for upper-class families, thereby blocking out lower-income families. Today we call this “exclusionary zoning” and its roots can be traced back nearly a century ago.</p>
<p>West Hartford became the first Connecticut town to enact municipal zoning in 1924, immediately after the state granted this power. Town leaders hired Robert Whitten, a consultant from Cleveland, Ohio, to guide this process. He drafted West Hartford’s first zoning guidelines, which emphasized how these land-use laws would bring “orderliness” and “efficiency” to real estate development in this rapidly growing suburb, “and an increase of health, comfort and happiness for all people.”<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>Whitten also recommended a system of dividing residential areas by minimum home construction sizes, to effectively segregate citizens by social class. In the most exclusive A district, constructing a single-family home required the largest size property lot (at least 9,000 square feet, or 1/5 of an acre), and building a two-family home required twice as much land. Similar rules mandated the minimum width of the property facing the street. The 1924 zoning plan clearly stated that these rules “will under most conditions, make it uneconomic to build two-family houses” in the A district. Exclusionary zoning required more land per family, which increased home prices to levels that only wealthier residents could afford. While zoning did not explicitly ban lower-class citizens, it effectively pushed them downward to the D-level districts (which permitted two-family duplexes with lower minimum property sizes), or out of the suburb entirely. Under the new zoning law, Hartford’s tenement houses and apartment buildings, crowded with working-class families, would be “effectively prevented in West Hartford.”<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> West Hartford town leaders voted to adopt most of their consultant’s recommendations.</p>

<p>Drafting local ordinances this way made zoning an exclusionary tool to restrict neighborhoods by wealth, and most likely to pump up high-end real estate sales. Unlike other tools developed around the same time (such as racially restrictive property covenants that prohibited non-white residents, and have since been outlawed by civil rights legislation), class-based zoning remains perfectly legal today. But it does nothing to promote the health and safety of the citizenry, as promised by the original intent of the state law.</p>
