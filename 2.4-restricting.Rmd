## Restricting with Property Covenants {- #restricting}

To some readers, this shockingly racist language might seem like a long-ago segregation policy from the Deep South. Instead, it comes from the Deep North and represents a hidden chapter in White suburban history. This racially restrictive *covenant*, which limits how land can be used, was placed by the owner in a *property deed*, a legal contract between sellers and buyers, typically filed with the local government agency, and can be enforced in court. Beginning in the 1920s, many real estate developers, homeowners' associations, and individual owners added racial covenants to prohibit anyone not considered part of the "white race" from owning or residing on selected property, perhaps with exceptions for domestic servants. If a Black resident moved in, a White resident could sue for breach of contract. In Connecticut, where property deeds are filed as public documents with a town clerk, race restrictive covenants were not merely agreements between individuals, but rather another form of government-supported housing discrimination. Eventually the U.S. Supreme Court ruled racial covenants to be unenforceable in 1948, and the 1968 Fair Housing Act made them unlawful, yet some property owners continued to file them in property deeds until 1972.

This chapter reveals the history of state-sponsored racial restrictions in Connecticut land records. So far, we and our colleagues have located 20 racial covenants that real estate developers placed on hundreds of properties for suburban home construction from the late 1930s into the 1940s. We have documented racial covenants in the Connecticut towns of Hamden, Manchester, Newington, and West Hartford, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1940-otl-covenants), with partial evidence pointing to more in East Hampton, Stamford, and other towns.^[See historical sources on Hamden, Manchester, Newington, West Hartford, and partial record for East Hampton in @ilyankouMapRaceRestrictive2017.

First, this chapter explains how race restrictive covenants arose in the nation beginning in the 1920s, and to our current knowledge, appeared later in Connecticut during the 1930s-40s, primarily in suburban housing developments. Although racist covenants were more common in Northern and Western cities such as Seattle, Minneapolis, and Chicago, so far those we have found in Connecticut vary, with a heavier concentration around New Haven suburbs than Hartford suburbs. Second, it describes how Connecticut civil rights advocates challenged restrictive covenants as an "un-American" policy during the late 1940s, and helped shift public opinion as the US Supreme Court ruled them to be unenforceable in 1948. In the present day, fair-housing advocates won passage of a 2021 Connecticut law that enables current homeowners to easily void racist covenants in the legal record, without erasing them from our collective memory. Overall, their historical legacy remains with us in two ways. On a tangible level, White homebuyers who purchased covenant-protected property gained financial benefits -- meaning higher home values in legally-guaranteed all-White neighborhoods -- that they passed forward as inheritances to future family members. On a structural level, the uncovering the hidden history of racist covenants in the Deep North reminds us how Connecticut's suburbs were shaped not simply by market forces, but also government-sponsored White supremacy.

### The Rise of Racial Covenants {-}
The nation's story of restrictive covenants begins with the U.S Supreme Court case *Corrigan v. Buckley* in 1921. White property owners in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington D.C. formed a property owners’ association that used racially restrictive covenants to keep out Black homebuyers. The dispute arose when White owner John Corrigan attempted to sell his house to an African-American buyer, Irene Curtis, a violation of the property’s racial covenant. Learning of this violation, White neighbor Irene Buckley brought suit to enforce the race restrictive covenant and stop the property sale.

As the case worked its way through the nation’s legal system, courts upheld this new tool for racial barriers in housing. First, the District of Columbia Supreme Court approved the racial covenant and cited existing legal segregation in schools and public recreational facilities as precedent. Second, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals also approved the racial covenant and stated that African Americans were free to include the same kind of racially exclusive language against Whites in their own property deeds. Finally, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the lower court decisions in 1926 by refusing to hear the case on grounds that they lacked jurisdiction. When Justice Edward Sanford delivered the U.S. Supreme Court’s opinion, he narrowly defined the Constitution’s guarantee that no person should “be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law” as it applied to *Corrigan v. Buckley*. While the Fifth Amendment limited the actions of the federal government, Sanford asserted that it did not apply to individuals entering into a private contact, such as a restrictive covenant. Moreover, he argued that the Thirteenth Amendment did not protect individual rights of Black citizens, and the Fourteenth Amendment again referred to actions of the state, not of private individuals. Therefore, the 1926 *Corrigan v. Buckley* decision reaffirmed the right of property owners to legally enforce race restrictive covenants, while ignoring that the court system itself acted as governmental support for segregation. Their interpretation of the Constitution would prevail for the next two decades.^[@corriganv.buckley1926; @prologuedcMappingSegregationWashington2015]

In emerging suburban communities across Connecticut, owners began adding non-racial types of deed restrictions to increase the desirability of property in the 1910s, perhaps earlier. For example in West Hartford, individual owners began to add home-value restrictions, requiring that future homes constructed on the land must be built above a minimum size or sold above a minimum dollar amount, to maintain property values. Some owners added restrictions to prohibit chicken coops or noxious fumes, again to raise property values. Finally, some West Hartford real estate developers began to add home-value restrictions across entire subdivisions, setting the stage for exclusionary zoning policies that the Town would later adopt in 1924, as described [in this book chapter](excluding.html). While these early 1900s home-value deed restrictions effectively limited neighborhoods to wealthier White families, they did not yet contain explicitly racist prohibitions.

To our knowledge, the first race restrictive covenants in property deeds filed with a Connecticut town clerk appeared in late 1939 in the Hartford suburb of Newington, based on research by David K. Ware. During the Depression, real estate developers sought ways to convert rural farmland to prospective homes and make it more attractive to city dwellers to purchase. One developer was Alfred E. Hanbury, who renamed farmland he purchased near the town's crossroads as the "Center Village" subdivision for future homes. Hanbury told city news reporters he was "optimistic concern[ing] the future of Newington as a residential community," with its gas and electric utilities, easy trolley commute to Hartford, and affordable Federal Housing Adminstration mortgages, a topic described [in this book chapter](lending.html). Hanbury added several restrictions to a handwritten deed he filed when selling five property lots to homebuyers in October 1939. First, he required that only single-family homes could be constructed, on plots of land no smaller than about one-fifth of an acre, with no noxious or offensive businesses that might annoy neighbors. Later in the deed, he added an explicitly racist restriction, probably drawn from language he had seen other developers using elsewhere. "No persons of any race except the white race shall use or occupy any buildings on any lot, except that this covenant shall not prevent occupancy by domestic servants of a different race employed by an owner or tenant," as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1934-1939-1950-newington-hanbury.png). Selling homes was challenging during the Depression and World War II, but Hanbury finally sold 47 units at Center Village after the war, started work on two more Newington developments, and was selected as one of the first directors of the Home Builders Association of Hartford County, reflecting his status within the profession.^[@hanburyCenterVillageSubdivision1939; On Hanbury's housing developments, see @WillErectHouses1937; @HanburyBuildBrick1946; @ContractorOptimisticOutlook1950; @AlfredHanburyNew1950; @AlfredHanburyDies1970]

(ref:1934-1939-1950-newington-hanbury.png) Alfred Hanbury developed Newington farmland [as shown in 1934] into the Center Village housing subdivision and added a [race restrictive covenant in 1939](https://ontheline.github.io/otl-covenants/index.html).

In nearby West Hartford, some real estate developers also added racial covenants to attract homebuyers to more exclusive all-White suburban neighborhoods. Edward Hammel, president of High Ledge Homes, Inc., added the first racial covenant we have found in West Hartford in 1940. Described as a “builder of fine homes” in wealthy areas of Westchester County, New York, and Fairfield County, Connecticut, Hammel introduced new methods to make unsold property more marketable. Hammel purchased a subdivision on South Main Street, across from the Rockledge Gold Course, consisting of 84 property lots that the prior owner, developer Robert Bent, had not been able to sell during the Depression. Hammel's land records added a "uniform plan of development" for single-family homes that also prohibited occupants “of any race except the white race.” Although High Ledge Homes did not openly publicize their White-only covenant, their 1940 advertising promised homebuyers that with A-level exclusionary zoning requirements, "you'll like your neighbors," as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1940-wh-high-ledge). The pitch also mentioned "West Hartford's famous schools," one of the earliest real estate advertising references to this young suburb’s public education system, and perhaps a premature one for this time period, when Hartford's city schools still had a stronger reputation. By 1941, at least four more West Hartford developers followed Hammel's lead and added racial covenants to their subdivisions.^[@100NewHomes1940; @AdModernHomes1940; @highledgehomesinc.AgreementConcerningBuilding1940.

In Manchester, a suburb located to the east of Hartford, at least three real estate developers added race restrictive covenants to subdivisions in the early 1940s, according to attorney David K. Ware. At this stage, the ban against occupants "other than the white race" for housing developments such as Greenway Park, now appeared on pre-printed forms designed for mass duplication to individual buyers. Yet Ware points out how racial covenants still remained "hidden" in two ways. First, the White-only restriction was buried in the fine print in section F in a long page (sections A-M) of seemingly innocuous restrictions, meaning it would not stand out to homeowners unless they carefully read every line of their property deed. Second, Ware argues that racial covenants were "temporally camouflaged" because the White-only language only appeared in the original version. For all future sales, the deed simply stated that the property was "subject to certain restrictions of record," which disguised its racist origins. For example, when Ware's parents bought their Manchester home in 1950, their property deed obscurely referred to "certain restrictions" in five prior real estate transactions -- in 1949, 1948, 1947, 1946, 1945 -- to the original racial restriction in the 1942 deed by Lawrence A. Converse, president of the Greenway Park development.  In the Deep North, racism could be well-hidden, yet legally powerful.^[@wareBlackWhiteGreenway2020, p. 4.

Overall, the "vast majority of Manchester’s developers did NOT use racially restrictive covenants. Data collected from the town’s land records is telling: Out of approximately 100 subdivisions approved in Manchester between roughly 1910 and 1950, only the three mentioned above (i.e. only about 3% of the subdivisions) used such covenants. Out of approximately 7,100 residential building lots represented by those 100 subdivisions, only the 248 lots within Greenway, Lakewood Circle and Bowers (i.e. only about 3.5%) were burdened with covenants that required the exclusion of nonwhites." p15

TODO
Elsewhere in Connecticut, race restrictive covenants were more frequently used by developers in New Haven suburbs, such as Hamden, based on research by June Gold.



TODO: Comparative CT paragraph

Based on our search of property records to date in West Hartford, the largest suburb of Hartford, we found only 5 race restrictive covenants, all created during the early 1940s. These covered about 200 parcels of land, or around 3 percent of the 6,000 single-family homes that had been constructed in the town around that time. In this suburb, race restrictive covenants did not appear in all neighborhoods that were developed during this time period, and where they did exist, they did not necessarily apply to every house in that neighborhood. Instead, West Hartford relied more on racial barriers in public housing, by real estate agents, and exclusionary zoning ordinances to restrict non-White and low-income residents. Eventually, race restrictive covenants faded away after the US Supreme Court ruled in 1948 that governments could not enforce these individual agreements.

On the whole, race restrictive covenants were more pervasive in other Northern and Western cities, such as Chicago and Los Angeles, than the metropolitan Hartford region.
Even though race restrictive covenants appeared in West Hartford in 1940, they had a longer legacy and more powerful influence in other cities.

Compared to Connecticut, restrictive covenants were *more* common in several other US cities, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:restrictive-cities). **TODO: REDO LIST TO MATCH?** In Chicago and Los Angeles, estimates of properties covered by racial covenants in the 1940s ranged from 50 to 80 percent. In Seattle, developers attached restrictive covenants to tens of thousands of homes in the city and its surrounding suburbs, which created a ring outside the central city of White-only neighborhoods. As a result, large numbers of African American, Asian, and Jewish residents were forced into the only housing available to them, and became highly concentrated into the Central Area and International Districts of the city. In Detroit, researcher Richard Rothstein estimates that white homeowners, real estate agents, and developers organized 192 associations to promote racial exclusion” from 1943 to 1965. And in St. Louis, where the landmark *Shelley v. Kraemer* case eventually made racial covenants unenforceable, the widespread prevalence of white-only covenants meant that only 2.5 percent of new housing construction was devoted to Black homeseekers in 1948.^[On the 50 percent estimate in Chicago, see @coatesCaseReparations2014.

### Challenging Racial Covenants, Past and Present {-}

While most restrictive covenants were racial, some also prohibited property ownership based on religion, specifically against Jews. In Hartford, Simon Bernstein, an attorney and Democratic member of the City Council, pressed the Judiciary Committee in Connecticut’s General Assembly to outlaw restrictive covenants “pertaining to nationality, color and religious belief” in 1947. He described his interest in a local case where the property deed limited the sale to “non Semitic persons of the Caucasian race.” Bernstein called for a bill to invalidate all restrictive covenants on the grounds that this “un-American practice... is contrary to public policy.” Without governmental action, Bernstein declared that “our town clerks are unwitting tools in transcribing prejudices on record, and are thus proclaiming by such governmental publication not only the evil deed, but also immunity against the world for such prejudices.” But Connecticut legislators waited for action from the federal government.^[@bernsteinLetterEditor1947; @BernsteinSeeksEnd1947; @StateLawSought1947. Some accounts describe Bernstein's involvement in a 1947 lawsuit against a property covenant restricted "non-Semitic persons of the Caucasian race" in West Hartford, according to @huttonBriefLookBack2014, p. 40. But in our oral history interview with Simon Bernstein at age 98, he recalled details about a race restrictive case in West Hartford that was settled out of court, but not the religion and race case briefly mentioned in this 1947 press account. See @bernsteinOralHistoryInterview2011. Tracey Wilson described anecdotal accounts of anti-Jewish and anti-Catholic covenants in West Hartford, but we have not yet found documentary evidence. See @wilsonHighLedgeHomes2018.]

TODO: integrate into above and emphasize anti-Semitic covenants
Hartford Alderman Simon Bernstein sends public letter dated 29 March 1947 to Senator Charles House, Chair of Judiciary Cmte at CT State Capitol, asking him to "raise in committee a bill which will forbid the sale and leasing" and "invalidate" all "restrictive covenants pertaining to nationality, color and religious belief"
it would be "a sound public policy to legislate against such an un-American practice"  without legislation "many courts have been helpless and have been forced to be unwilling protectors of this shameful practice"
 "real estate deals are public records" and "our Town Clerk's are unwitting tools in transcribing prejudices on record, and are thus proclamining by such governmental publication not only the evil deed, but also immunity against the world for such prejudices"
Many towns contain these records. "For example, in a nearby town will be found a covenant, restricting sale of property 'to only non-semitic members of the Caucasian race.' The vendors of this particular tract also warrant that like restrictions will be imposed on all other purchasers of lots within the entire tract."
"invalidating such restrictive covenants is constitutional, both because in generall, all restrictive covenants are frowned upon by the courts and, in particular, because this type of restrictive covenants is contrary to public policy"
copied to Rep Louis Shapiro
@bernsteinLetterEditor1947

By the late 1940’s across the nation, civil rights activists successfully began to turn the tide against racial covenants, both in the courts and the realm of public opinion. The US Supreme Court heard *Shelley v. Kraemer*, a compilation of race restrictive covenant cases that NAACP attorneys advanced from St. Louis, Detroit, and Washington, DC. President Truman’s Committee on Civil Rights came out against racial covenants, and the U.S. Department of Justice filed a brief also condemning this discriminatory policy. In its 1948 ruling, the Supreme Court agreed that private parties could voluntarily agree to race restrictive covenants, but for the judicial system to enforce these agreements qualified as a discriminatory state action, and therefore violated the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore, the *Shelley v. Kraemer* ruling overturned the logic of the 1926 *Buckley v. Corrigan decision*, which refused to acknowledge legal enforcement of contracts as an act of government. But race restrictive covenants did not disappear overnight. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) continued to require racial covenants for properties it insured until 1950, and continued to back mortgages for some white-only properties until 1962. Also, several state courts resisted the *Shelley* decision until a subsequent US Supreme Court decision in 1953. Finally, some local governments continued to accept unenforceable race covenants as legal property documents until this practice was overruled by the federal courts in 1972.[@shelleyv.kraemer1948; @rothsteinColorLawForgotten2017 pp. 85-91; @mayersv.ridleyDecision1972]

Although race-restrictive covenants were no longer legally enforceable after 1948, their legacy continued to influence later generations. Whites who bought into restricted West Hartford neighborhoods during the 1940s benefitted financially from government-sanctioned segregation that boosted property values. Decades later, their descendants also benefitted from this inherited wealth. Even after restrictive covenants no longer had judicial backing, the fact of their existence—--and the all-White neighborhoods they created—--sent a signal to potential buyers about the racial preferences of their neighbors. Years after the Shelley decision, some West Hartford homebuyers were told by their lawyers that a non-enforceable racial covenant still existed on their property deeds. And Black homebuyers had to decide whether or not to live in a neighborhood with a documented past of being openly hostile to their presence.[@everettOralHistoryInterview2011; @brooksSavingNeighborhoodRacially2013]

Most present-day residents of West Hartford’s High Ledge Homes development were shocked to learn that their neighborhood had been protected by a 1940s White-only covenant, and sought to make sense of its meaning on their lives. Debra Walsh, an educator and actor, reflected on the White privilege that was attached to her decision to buy her home in 2010, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:2011-walsh-debra). Although she had believed that the North had not exhibited such explicit racist policies, the direct evidence of race restrictive covenants convinced her that “West Hartford made a concerted effort to stay White and WASPy and that contributes to the feel of the neighborhood.” Walsh acknowledged how the explicit racism of the covenants in her own neighborhood made her feel uncomfortable with the White privilege she experiences. “It's really hard to look really deep within and answer those questions,” she explained, “...when you live in the dominant class. Like you don't know how to answer it.” Even though she knew the covenants are no longer enforceable, Walsh could see how “the legacy of the piece of land gets passed on to a feeling of a neighborhood,” a sense of White exclusivity that pervades even today, when barriers take on less overtly racial language.^[@walshOralHistoryInterview2011]

Yet while racial covenants make White West Hartford residents uncomfortable about the past, they remain an important piece of history, a hidden chapter that deserves more attention. Susan Hansen, a librarian and White resident who bought her home in the High Ledge Homes neighborhood in the 1990s, reflected on this theme during a present-day oral history interview, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:2011-hansen-susan). “I think this is something that people should know,” Hansen observed, “because there are people still living on my street who were here then, who must have been fully aware.” Hansen also emphasized the importance of knowing that racial covenants were not something that happened only in the Deep South long ago, but are a very recent part of Northern suburban history that should not be whitewashed out of memory. As Hansen concluded, "We need to know that we were being idiots up here, too, and it wasn't somewhere else. It was here. It's still here."^[@hansenOralHistoryInterview2011]
