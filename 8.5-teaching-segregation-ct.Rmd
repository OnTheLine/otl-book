While researching and writing this *On The Line* book-in-progress with undergraduate students at Trinity College, our primary goal has been to make visible the hidden boundary lines that have divided metropolitan Hartford from the past to the present, in order to engage wider audiences with our troubled history and pathways to changing our future. Rather than waiting until the full manuscript is finished, my contributors and I created this open-access book and uploaded chapters as we completed them to make this history more findable and useful. Also, we strived to write introductory-level chapters---since that's where all of us begin---and to offer clear explanations instead of complex jargon. Pictures also play an important role in the book, and we've added interactive maps, charts, and other illustrations to help communicate concepts that can be difficult to grasp with words alone.

The racial and economic segregation we see today did not happen overnight, nor was it caused by nature. The segregated patterns today were created by decisions made by prior generations of elected leaders, real estate interests, and homebuyers. Making sense of how cities and suburbs evolved over time is not simple. But if we really want to dismantle *systemic racism* and related power structures that shape our present-day reality, then we need to understand how these *systems* actually work.

Teaching historical thinking is one part of the solution. In my prior work as a secondary school teacher, I learned the power of posing thoughtful questions---and providing accessible primary sources---to guide students to think like historians. Sam Wineburg and colleagues have created several valuable resources to assist K-12 teachers in this process, which build on the field of inquiry-based learning.^[@wineburgReadingHistorianTeaching2011; @thompsonExaminingEvidenceSeven2014] In our state, Rebecca Furer has led the development of the [TeachItConnecticut](https://teachitct.org) at CT Humanities, a growing collection of inquiry-based lesson plans to help elementary and secondary educators guide students to "think like historians" with Connecticut primary sources. To be clear, more work remains to be done. In particular, we need to fulfill the promise of [CT Public Act 19-12](https://pa1912.serc.co) to include Black and Latino Studies in the public school curriculum. We also need to continually rethink the *mainstream* curriculum, and ways to connect White students and communities with the Connecticut's history of segregation, and how to speaks to all of us.

In this spirit, this chapter suggests ways to pair historical questions and source materials from the *On The Line* book that educators are welcome to freely borrow and adapt for their classrooms. While my current teaching context is at the college level, I've always been impressed by K-12 educators who find creative ways to integrate complex topics into the K-12 curriculum. If you have inquiry-based Connecticut history lesson plans you wish to share with other educators, consider [sharing it with TeachItCT](https://teachitct.org/questions/), or if you teaching ideas that are directly relevant to *On The Line*, please [contact the authors](authors.html).

### Neighborhood Change {-}
Question: How have neighborhoods changed in Connecticut from 1934 to today?

- Enter your home address. What looks different between then and now? What looks similar?
- Follow the path from your home to school. What differences or similarities do you notice?
- What might have caused the changes you see in the photos?
- What kinds of things can you *not* see in the aerial photos?

### Redlining Neighborhoods {-}
Question: During the 1930s Depression, federal government officials and local bankers created maps and documents showing neighborhoods where they recommended giving loans to home owners. Years later, we call these "redlining" maps. What factors influenced their neighborhood ratings?

Sources: [Map of Federal Home Owner's Loan Corporation (HOLC) "Redlining" in Hartford Area, CT, 1937](https://ontheline.github.io/otl-redlining/index-caption.html).

(ref:1937-otl-redlining-teaching) Click on color-coded areas in the [full-screen interactive map](https://ontheline.github.io/otl-redlining/index-caption.html) to view one-page HOLC appraisals for each neighborhood in 1937, and the factors that field agents and local banks and lenders considered. They rated not only the physical condition of property, but also the "social status of the population," and downgraded neighborhoods with Black, immigrant, and lower-income residents. Decades later, activists labeled these discriminatory lending practices as "redlining."

According to the National Archives, HOLC materials also exist for Bridgeport and New London, Connecticut, but have not yet been digitized.

Activity: Explore the interactive map and documents, or download them for your area. Assign student teams to focus on different neighborhoods and pool their findings. How did the mapmakers rate and describe different neighborhoods? What factors influenced their recommendations about who should receive home loans?

Warning: The 1930s redlining maps and documents contain harmful words that reflect the racial, ethnic, and economic prejudices of the people who created them. Don't allow your lesson to reinforce stereotypes. Teach students to recognize and disrupt inequalities.

### Who Lived Here? {-}
Questions: Who lived in a specific house or street long ago? Which residents stayed, and which ones moved? How do different streets or neighborhoods compare on stability or turnover? What factors might have influenced people's decisions? What do these patterns tell us about neighborhood change?

Activity: Access the subscription-only Ancestry database, “US City Directories, 1822-1995,” https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/2469/, and download pages for specific streets if needed. Many CT public libraries provide access to Ancestry.com when using the library network. Some public libraries also provide access to the HeritageQuest database when using your library card, https://www.heritagequestonline.com/.

### Where Can You Afford to Live? {-}
Teaching the history of segregation can be challenging if learners do not have personal experience with searching for an apartment or house to rent or buy. See the [Home School Shopping simulation](home-school-shopping.html) in this book.

### Oral History {-}
Build stronger inter-generational communication and understanding with oral history interviews. See activities in the [Teaching Oral History](teaching-oral-history.html) section of this book.
