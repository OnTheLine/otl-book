# Excluding Through Zoning Lines **NEW** {#excluding}
This chapter makes the hidden history of residential zoning more visible. In present-day housing debates, *exclusionary zoning* refers to local government policies that favor the construction of expensive single-family homes on large tracts of land, rather than more affordable multi-family homes on smaller properties. In Connecticut, the origins of exclusionary zoning can be traced back to one suburban town's attempt to block an urban Jewish grocer from building a store in a residential neighborhood in the early 1920s. While this conflict centered around commercial development, it triggered a new phase in ongoing disputes over who controlled real estate, and the legal tools that property owners and local governments used to separate themselves from people they deemed as undesirable neighbors. In other words, exclusionary zoning legally limits who can afford to live in a neighborhood. Unlike other discriminatory barriers of this era---such as [mortgage redlining](lending.html) or [restrictive covenants](restricting.html) or [segregated public housing](public-housing.html)---exclusionary zoning did not directly refer to race, religion, or nationality. Instead, zoning policies cleverly carved up suburban neighborhoods using minimum-land rules that segregated residents by their wealth. In this way, exclusionary zoning became a more sophisticated and so-called color-blind tool of housing discrimination that largely resisted fair-housing legislation of the 1960s-70s civil rights era, and continues to divide Connecticut into the present day.
