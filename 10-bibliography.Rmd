### About undergraduate co-authors {-}
Since 2002, over 30 Trinity College student researchers have co-authored publications and/or research presentations with faculty, staff, and community partners through the [Cities Suburbs and Schools Project](http://commons.trincoll.edu/cssp/). CSSP is both an undergraduate seminar and a research team for independent studies. Their works listed below include articles, book chapters, papers, and presentations, and many of these have been archived in the [Papers and Publications section](http://digitalrepository.trincoll.edu/cssp_papers/) of the Cities Suburbs and Schools Project on the Trinity College Digital Repository.
