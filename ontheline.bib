But that’s not all it shows. Looking at the results from three cohorts of students on the CT Mastery Test (CMT), the mini-report examined data for Hartford children who began taking the CMT in 2005-2006, 2006-2007, and 2007- 2008, respectively, to see how much they progressed year over year until eighth grade. The three groups were not matched cohorts – that is, attrition data were not available to account for migration of students from school to school or new arrivals at schools during the years examined. Yet, at a high level, the data for these last three cohorts to take the CMT, before its discontinuation in 2013, do show modest increases through Grade 5 and larger increases at Grade 6, before a drop-off at Grades 7 and 8. While the academic velocity of individual Hartford schools has wide variability, magnet schools typically see more growth over the years and have higher levels of performance than do neighborhood schools – but not in all cases, especially when you break out the performance of only Hartford students at magnet schools. The drop-off in performance from Grade 6 to Grade 8 is a major concern, as it negates much of what students were able to gain from Grade 3 to Grade 6 – and makes it nearly impossible to close the achievement gap with the State average by high school graduation. It also comes at a crucial time, just before the transition to high school. The detailed results in the full mini-report are available here. Academic velocity findings at each individual school are fascinating – but mostly as they relate to the variability of each school’s performance, given that the cohort data we have do not account for migration of students from one school to another."},

  abstract = {"As Hartford has steadily increased the percentage of its students enrolled in racially and socio-economically integrated schools, the gap between high-quality and chronically low-performing schools has emerged as a defining issue for the city and regional futures. To address it, we believe, stipulations in the Sheff v. O’Neill case over quality integrated education in Greater Hartford ought to be re-adjusted to better address verifiable needs among the city’s students and families. One result would be to return the perception of Sheff among Hartford families to where it started: a landmark case and catalyst for educational quality in Hartford. This is important. In recent years, last-minute magnet school designations have sprung suddenly upon families and significantly undermined grassroots support. With all of this in mind, Achieve Hartford! recommends eight improvements for the 2014-15 Sheff negotiations between the State and the plaintiffs. In the past, the negotiations have both expanded – and led to unintended consequences that curtail – parent options. To get those options and opportunities right, a fine-grain reconsideration is timely. Here are our eight recommendations:"},

Whereas the current method of reporting CMT and CAPT results provides a “snapshot” of student achievement in a given year, the cohort approach allows us to track the performance of a group of students as they progress from late elementary school into high school. With this analysis, we can address the important question of whetherstudents are building on gains in learning from prior years.The purpose of this report, however, is not to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the district or particular schools; instead, this report seeks to provide (1) a detailed explanation of a relatively new method of measuring student and school performance, (2) demonstrate the utility of this new method, and (3) highlight just a couple areas of success and concern for the benefit of not only the school district, but for the greater community as well},

"This dissertation chronicles significant political and socio-historical events that shaped the African-American community from the colonial period to the late twentieth century. The scholarly research uses Connecticut’s 1996 school desegregation case: Sheff v. O’Neill as a lens to trace the fight for citizenship and its essential component: a quality education. On April 27, 1989 eighteen children and their parents filed a school desegregation case in Hartford Superior Court. The lawsuit took the name of then ten-year old Milo Sheff, who was among other plaintiffs from the city and a suburb of Hartford, the state’s capital city. In this suit, the plaintiffs’ lawyers asserted that state violated its own Constitution by its laws and policies, which created segregated schools. More importantly, the state violated its own civil rights law that affords all citizens equal protection. Combative in its defense, the state claimed that Connecticut did not intentionally segregated whites and minorities and cannot be held accountable for the disparities in the school system. On July 9, 1996, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, saying intentional or not, Connecticut violated Hartford’s children equal opportunity to a quality education. The Court further concluded that school districting based on town and city boundary lines since 1909 was unconstitutional. This dissertation situates Sheff within the narrative of a long civil rights struggle by blacks in Connecticut. By highlighting the contours of the black experience in New England, it also chronicles the political, socio-historical evolution leading to the lawsuit, its impact on Hartford and the nation’s collective memory of New England as the cradle of abolitionists. By using newspaper accounts, census records, oral history, city files, U.S Census records, letters, state records and archives, this historical account seeks to be a paradigmatic study of the black experience in Connecticut and argues that the state’s history of segregation and resistance to black education is evidence enough to prove intent to segregate minority and white students."},

This analysis extends the residential attainment literature by examining the neighborhood racial composition of middle-class blacks and whites while controlling for residential preferences. Methods.  Using the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality and 1990 Census data, the spatial assimilation and place stratification theories of locational attainment are tested. Results.  As in previous research, support is shown for both theories; for blacks, stronger human capital characteristics translate into neighborhoods that are less racially segregated. However, even when middle-class blacks prefer to live in integrated neighborhoods, on average, they live in neighborhoods that are about 60 percent black and 30 percent white, while middle-class whites who prefer to live in integrated neighborhoods reside in neighborhoods that, on average, are 10 percent black and 85 percent white. Conclusions.  Although incorporating residential preferences into models that predict neighborhood racial composition proves important, the relative inability of middle-class blacks to implement their preferences indicates powerful social forces that maintain “American apartheid.”},

Criterion variables used to evaluate the treatment were mental ability, academic achievement, personal-social development, and creativity. Findings of a 1968 evaluation suggested that the bused experimental children in suburban classes in grades K-3 had a significantly greater tendency to show growth in mental ability than the control children remaining in inner city classrooms. In grades 4 and 5, however, the controls showed better achievement than the experimentals. The effects of supportive assistance were mixed. It was felt that the placement of two or three children in a suburban classroom had no measurable negative effect on the academic achievement},

Holden appeared before the West Hartford town council last night by special invitation, to defend his proposal for a Greater Hartford commission appointed by the governor to study the common problems of water supply, sewage disposal and zoning." WH town council members suspicious of motivations unanimously opposed bill at prior meeting; State Rep John W Huling "declared that the bill was a covert move toward eventual annexation" Holden seeks to clear up misunderstanding: "This bill has absolutely nothing to do with the annexation of West Hartford," he declared. "Why it's foolishness to even consider bringing West Hartford into Hartford," he said. "It won't happen within the next fifty years, you can depend on that." Instead, Holden focused on "mutual protection of the towns involved against the serious menace of the ever increasing problems of water supply and sewage disposal. He pointed out that the towns are so closely interwoven in interests with each other and so interdependent that they responsibilities and problems of one were equaly shared by all the others." Comm would include Hartford, West Hartford, Wethersfield, Windsor, Bloomfield and Newington "If there is an epidemic of typhoid in Newington it will close the schools of West Hartford," he said. "If the water of Hartford is contaminated, your children who work in the offices of our city will be poisoned when they drink it. We've got to work together. We've got to form some kind of interlocking body to study these problems, discuss them and find solutions." Commission would have 3 men for each town appointed by governor "to avoid a 'stacked' board"; half of commission expense by Hartford, one-fourth by West Hartford, and remainder by other smaller towns Holden described it as a "great big efficient business proposition, absolutely above board and for the best interests of the several communities concerned." Commission members would receive no pay Holden warns of future danger if no cooperative action is taken; "if Hartford and West Hartford continued to consume the amount of water during the next ten years that they had used in the past decade, they would be buying water from Massachusetts..."},

Later, the legislature passed a special act, 1929 Conn. Spec. Acts p. 859, which consolidated the city and town school districts. The special act required acceptance by the voters. Two questions were placed on the ballot, one to approve the consolidation and one to accept the special act. The voters rejected the consolidation but approved the special act. The court found that the special act became valid and effective by virtue of the votes taken because the purpose of the special act was clearly to accomplish the consolidation of the school districts and the fact that the voters voted against the consolidation was superfluous where they voted to accepted the special act. The court further held that Conn. Gen. Stat. § 257b was applicable notwithstanding that consolidation was effected under the special act because a provision for adjustment of differences in the value of property of the respective districts was an integral feature of the consolidation of school districts and there was no implied repeal of § 257b by the special act.},

As of 2012, all but nine U.S. states allowed charter schools, and in one of those nine, Washington State, charter school legislation was passed by popular vote in November 2012. There is a substantial, if contested, research base focusing on charter school effectiveness, particularly related to test score achievement, as well as an equally contested literature base on charter school enrollment selectivity, student expulsions, and increased segregation in charter school populations. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyze the network of relations of policy actors surrounding the statewide campaign to pass the charter school Initiative 1240 in Washington State in order to better understand how wealthy individuals and their associated philanthropic organizations influence educational policy. Research Design: Making use of available tax records, public election information, individual and organizational websites, and institutional and foundation databases, this study uses simple directed graphing techniques from social network analysis to analyze the complex relationships and affiliations of policy actors relative to the campaign to pass charter school Initiative 1240 in the state of Washington. Conclusions/Recommendations: This study concludes that, compared to the average voter in Washington, an elite group of wealthy individuals, either directly through individual donations or indirectly through their affiliated philanthropic organizations, wielded disproportionate influence over the outcome of the charter school initiative in the state, thereby raising serious concerns about the democratic underpinnings of an education policy that impacts all of the children in Washington State. This study also concludes that elite individuals make use of local nonprofit organizations as a mechanism to advance their education policy agenda by funding those nonprofits through the philanthropic organizations affiliated with those same wealthy elites. In light of these conclusions, the authors recommend that a mechanism for more democratic accountability be developed relative to education policy campaigns, initiatives, and legislation."},

  abstract = {The arrest of Fred Trump during a Ku Klux Klan (KKK) rally in New York City in 1927 came to light during the 2016 election campaign, but no one grasped its full historical significance. This article sets this contentious episode within the larger history of the Klan and the racial contests that scarred life in the interwar metropolitan fringe to produce a new account of how racially segregated communities were formed. The article finds a decade-long contested process of overlapping layers, driven by debates over race and national identity; tense relationships between community groups; the political machinery of city, state and federal governments; competition between civic groups for access to services; and all set against a turbulent speculative world of interwar real estate. The article argues racially redlined communities were created by a decade-long grassroots battle fought from below just as much as they were imposed from above by political decision-makers. Argues that informal "grassroots redlining" by private property owners in 1920s was later solidified into formal public policy by HOLC and FHA in 1930s and 40s. Builds on Thomas Hanchett study of HOLC policy in Charlotte where effect was to "solidify practices that had previously existed only informally"},

In response, university administrators have aimed to enrich their campuses and the surrounding areas with amenities to attract students and faculty, especially in urban areas where students can explore cities from the safety of the ivory tower. But what, then, becomes of the communities and cultures surrounding these campuses? In In the Shadow of the Ivory Tower, historian Davarian L. Baldwin argues that urban universities have been key forces behind the gentrification of America's cities; in fact, urban planners have used the profitable high-tech high-density model of the university campus as a blueprint for the city as a whole. As a result, the Black and Latino communities that largely surrounded campuses are left especially vulnerable, at the mercy of skyrocketing property values, discriminatory campus police forces and the need for low-wage high education labor. Universities are treating cities as their company towns, and catering to the whims of students for the sake of profit means that these longstanding communities are bulldozed over, metaphorically and literally. Despite these implications, everyone from New York to Arizona wants to build a UniverCity. Baldwin takes us on a journey from his own university in Hartford to Chicago, from Phoenix to Manhattan, using these case studies to illustrate the increasingly parasitic relationship between higher education and urban planning. In the Shadow of the Ivory Tower is a wake-up call to the reality that higher education is no longer the ubiquitous public good it was once thought to be, and an urgent call for a more equitable relationship between American cities and universities"--},

The reviewers praise Eaton's richly-textured representations of METCO alumni experiences, but they question whether the evidence supports her major policy claim that nearly all alumni would repeat the program if given the opportunity. Based on the reviewers' parallel study of Hartford's Project Concern alumni, the essay calls attention to "forced choices" faced by many African Americans in these city-suburban programs, and discusses the broader implications for contemporary policy debate on school desegregation and the vouchers movement.},

  abstract = {on bookshelf Describes in rich  detail African American daily life among free blacks in the North in the 1860s.  Based  on a treasure trove of more than two hundred personal letters written in the 1860s, Hopes and Expectations tells the  story of three young African Americans in the North. Living on Marylands  eastern shore, schoolteacher Rebecca Primus sent home weeklies to her parents  in Hartford and also corresponded with friend Addie Brown, a domestic worker  back home. Addie wrote voluminously to Rebecca, lamenting their separation and  describing her struggle to achieve a semblance of security and stability.  Around the same time, Rebeccas brother, Nelson, began writing home about his  new life in Boston, as he set out to make a name and a career for himself as an  artist. The letters describe their daily lives and touch on race, class,  gender, religion, and politics, offering rare entry into individual black lives  at that time.  Through  extensive archival research, Barbara J. Beeching also shows how the story of  the Primus family intersects with changes over time in Hartfords black  community and the country. Newspapers and census tracts, as well as probate,  land, court, and vital records help her trace an arc of local black fortunes  between 1830 and 1880. Seeking full equality, blacks sought refinement and  respectability through home ownership, literacy, and social gains. One of the many  paradoxes Beeching uncovers is that just as the Civil War was tearing the  nation apart, a recognizable black middle class was emerging in Hartford. It is a story of individuals, family, and community, of expectation and disappointment, loss and endurance,  change and continuity.This is a powerful book and a truly important  story. Beeching provides a richly detailed survey of life in Connecticut, the  political and racial climates at various historical moments, and the web of intraracial  and interracial networks that informed the Primus family experiences.  Multifaceted and thoroughly absorbing, Hopes  and Expectations will reintroduce people to a New England that they thought  they knew.  Lois Brown, author of Pauline  Elizabeth Hopkins: Black Daughter of the Revolution},

Drawing on spatial analyses of parents’ choice sets, the schools within two miles of their homes, and longitudinal in‐depth interviews, I describe a range of ways in which geography shaped 36 parents’ choices of middle and high schools in Detroit. Parents considered a small fraction of the schools near their homes; however, all the parents discussed geographic characteristics of schools. The role geography played in the choice process ranged from nonexistent to framing. By investigating how parents’ geographic preferences played out with respect to their other preferences and the existing supply of schools, this study contributes to the field’s increasingly nuanced understanding of parents’ decision making.},

As a lawyer and Hartford alderman in 1947, he publicly challenged racially restrictive covenants in property deeds. In 1950, he and his family moved to suburban Bloomfield, CT, where he served on the local board of education. In 1965, as a delegate to the Connecticut Constitutional Convention, he authored an amendment that guaranteed a free public education to every child, which laid the legal foundation for the 1970s Horton v. Meskill school finance cases, the 1989 Sheff v O'Neill school desegregation lawsuit, and the Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc. v Rell ruling in 2010. In addition, he discusses his relationships with Democratic Party chairman John Bailey, Governor Abraham Ribicoff, Hartford Mayor Thomas Spellacy, and his later role as a judge. Finally, he recalls memories of growing up as a Jewish boy in Hartford's Frog Hollow neighborhood and attending nearby Trinity College, where he graduated with the Class of 1933.},

This study presents evidence that interdistrict magnet schools have provided students from Connecticut’s central cities access to less racially and eco- nomically isolated educational environments and estimates the impact of attending a magnet school on student achievement. To address potential selection biases, the analyses exploit the random assignment that results from lottery-based admissions for a small set of schools, as well as value- added and fixed-effect estimators that rely on pre–magnet school measures of student achievement to obtain effect estimates for a broader set of interdistrict magnet schools. Results indicate that attendance at an interdistrict magnet high school has positive effects on the math and reading achievement of central city students and that interdistrict magnet middle schools have positive effects on reading achievement."},

With comparison groups consisting of students drawn from the same districts or districts with similar student body characteristics as the districts where treatment group students reside, using pretreatment test scores reduces the bias in nonexperimental methods between 64 and 96 percent. Adding pretreatment test scores does not achieve as much bias reduction when the comparison group consists of students drawn from districts with different student body characteristics than the treatment group students’ districts.

We examine whether the likelihood of opting out of one's geographically assigned school differs across groups and compare the actual peer composition in neighborhood schools to what the peer composition in those schools would be under a counterfactual scenario in which all students attend their geographically assigned schools. We find that many advantaged students have used school choice programs in Durham to opt out of assigned schools with concentrations of disadvantaged students and to attend schools with higher achieving students. Comparisons of actual peer compositions with the counterfactual scenario indicate only small differences in peer composition for nonchoosers on average. More substantial differences in peer environment emerge, however, for students in schools with concentrations of disadvantaged students and schools located near choice schools attractive to high achievers. The results suggest that expansions of parental choice may have significant adverse effects on the peer environments of a particularly vulnerable group of students."},

  abstract = {Investigates parental demand and participation in Open Choice in Hartford from 2002 to 2006 (and acknowledges that policies have shifted since this time) While Frankenberg 2007 argued that the demand for Open Choice seats far exceeds the supply, this needs some qualification. First, due to the high rate of students who did not accept a lottery invitation to enroll in Open Choice, comparing only applicants to open seats overstates the number. Second, Open Choice participation varies widely across grade levels, with virtually all PreK-2 students with reasonable lottery numbers to be placed, but less so in higher grade levels. p2-3 See also the "sibling privilege" in Open Choice: 11 percent of applicants had sibling currently enrolled, and received lottery preference (which has the unintended effect of perpetuating racial patterns). **Spatial that authors may not have explored: Are urban families more likely to decline Open Choice placements as the location of the suburban school increases in distance from Hartford? **LOOK TO SEE HOW CREC vs RSCO decline data is collected. Does it include name of placement district/school? Conclusion: "In summary, Black students in Hartford are both more likely to apply to Open Choice and more likely to accept an offer to participate than are Hispanic students. The result is substantially higher participation rates among Black students than Hispanic students. Males and females are equally likely to apply to Open Choice, but females are more likely to accept an offer to participate, leading to slightly higher participation rates among females. Finally, we found some differences in participation by geography. Particularly, a relatively high percentage of students from school attendance zones located in the northern sections of Hartford apply to and participate in Open Choice. The concentration of Open Choice students from these attendance zones can be observed despite the fact that these areas are not located closer to districts that offer Open Choice seats. Efforts to expand Open Choice and to ensure equal access to all Hartford students should begin with investigations of why Hispanic students, males, and students from the southern sections of the city are less likely to participate." Note that although authors claim that "student race is not used in determining admissions" (p. 1), the CT statutes restrict the degree of participation by race and residence (see my Sheff chapter).},

The results of our empirical analysis are consistent with these theoretical considerations.

These programs were not sufficient in addressing the depth of the problems that caused and maintained school segregation in Hartford, and the root cause of school segregation, neighborhood segregation, was never addressed in the solutions. In addition, I will show that a lack of directive towards ensuring quality in integrated schools has been a shortcoming in giving all Hartford public schoolchildren an equitable education, not just an integrated one."},

But since the mid-20th century, these cities have lost jobs and population and now face daunting social, economic and operational challenges. But a regional economy doesn't stop at the city line, especially with a small city such as Hartford, so legacy cities have to be better connected to their regions, the authors say. Each needs the others' assets; they rise and fall together. The Brookings Institution has persuasively argued that it is the metropolitan regions, not cities or states, that are the country's economic engines. Hartford's connections with its suburbs is not strong. There's a regional water and sewer authority and an active council of governments, but this remains the land of localism. Could there ever be more formal regional governance here? It would be a hard sell, to be sure, particularly with schools. But perhaps — someday — something like the two-tier Miami-Dade structure might appeal, in which each municipality has an elected government and provides some services such as police, while a county or regional government oversees two dozen other departments including parks, public works, economic development and transit. The authors acknowledge the political obstacles to creating such an entity, but say the potential benefits — cost savings and efficiencies in government and a more productive planning and economic development system — are worth the effort. regionalism},

  abstract = {This research investigates the experience of systemic restricted choice and its impact on self-concept among racial and ethnic minority consumers seeking financing. Choosing loans is an involved consumer choice journey, and encountering systemic, chronic, and uncontrollable restrictions on choice at any level of the goal/choice hierarchy limits and even prohibits minorities' ability to make desired choices. Across a multimethod investigation, these three studies demonstrate that minorities experiencing systemic restricted choice endure deleterious impacts to self-concept, including framing the self as fettered, alone, discriminated, and subservient, as well as marked reductions in self-esteem, self-autonomy, and self-efficacy. Minority consumers also frame themselves as striving in a world of limited resources and fighting uphill, often losing battles. Juxtaposing the experiences of racial/ethnic minorities against the choice journeys of educationally and economically similar white consumers puts those minority experiences in sharp relief. The theoretical and transformative consumer research implications of these findings are discussed. Marketplace radio 2015-07-02: "For a study published last year in a journal from Oxford University Press, a team of researchers from Rutgers, Brigham Young and Utah State universities sent “mystery shoppers” into about 80 banks. They posed as small business owners looking for a loan. They all had the same story and the same outfit — and were even selected to be equally tall and good looking — but some were black, some were white and some were Latino. As one of the researchers, Rutgers business professor Jerome Williams, puts it: “We found significant differences.” The study found bank officers asked tougher questions of minority applicants. For instance, they wanted to see more years of financial records. The mystery shoppers also used hidden cameras.  According to the study, everybody who saw the tapes agreed: bank officers were just nicer to white applicants. With white applicants, Williams says, “There was a lot of bantering, interaction, jokes — being very, very friendly.” With the black and Latino mystery shoppers, not so much. It led to a simple conclusion. For black and Latino entrepreneurs looking for a bank loan, “The playing field is not level,” Williams says. “There’s already a mark against you in terms of your background in applying for a loan.”},

  abstract = {This paper is part of a policy history that seeks to briefly tell the story of the Lanham Act and its local implementation in one of the nation’s most congested war production centers. I make two primary arguments. First, following historian Kristin Szylvian, I argue that the Lanham Act should be divided into three distinct periods: a period between 1940 and mid-1942 when federal funds went toward the construction of what I call ‘educative neighborhoods’; a period between mid-1942 and 1945 when Lanham funds went toward the construction of temporary sites; and a post-war period between 1945 and 1954 when war housing and school facilities were either shuttered, sold, or transferred to local public authorities. Second, in the case of Seattle, I argue that the industrial recruitment of Southern black labor to work at Boeing and Seattle shipyards beginning in the summer of 1942 corresponded with the shift from permanent to temporary housing construction. This shift would set the stage for post-war civil rights activism as temporary housing closed and a racially restricted housing market re-concentrated African American war workers, veterans, and their families.},

  abstract = {The fashion identities in the context of a wider conversation about American nationhood, to whom it belongs and what belonging means. Race and ethnicity, class, gender, and sexuality are all staple ingredients in this conversation. They are salient aspects of social being from which economic practices, political policies, and popular discourses create "Americans." Because all of these facets of social being have such significant meaning on a national scale, they also have major consequences for both individuals and groups in terms of their success and well-being, as well as how they perceive themselves socially and politically. The history of Jews in the United States is one of racial change that provides useful insights on race in America. Prevailing classifications have sometimes assigned Jews to the white race and at other times have created an off-white racial designation for them. Those changes in racial assignment have shaped the ways American Jews of different eras have constructed their ethnoracial identities. Brodkin illustrates these changes through an analysis of her own family's multi-generational experience. She shows how Jews experience a kind of double vision that comes from racial middleness: on the one hand, marginality with regard to whiteness; on the other, whiteness and belonging with regard to blackness. Class and gender are key elements of race-making in American history. Brodkin suggests that this country's racial assignment of individuals and groupsconstitutes an institutionalized system of occupational and residential segregation, is a key element in misguided public policy, and serves as a pernicious foundational principle in the construction of nationhood. Alternatives available to non-white and alien "others" have been either to whiten or to be consigned to an inferior underclass unworthy of full citizenship. The American ethnoracial map-who is assigned to each of these poles-is continually changing, although the binary of black and white is not. As a result, the structure within which Americans form their ethnoracial, gender, and class identities is distressingly stable. Brodkin questions the means by which Americans construct their political identities and what is required to weaken the hold of this governing myth.},

  abstract = {For a century, zoning — the local-government regulation of land use, structures, and lots through the assignment of lots to distinctly regulated districts — has dictated how and where we live. This groundbreaking project asks a simple question: how do zoning laws impact housing in Connecticut? To answer it, my team catalogued, coded, and analyzed housing-related zoning for all 2,622 zoning districts in Connecticut, where virtually all of the private land is subject to zoning. It is the first time the full variation of zoning districts in one state has been rendered at all, much less in such substantive detail and in the interactive graphic form of the Connecticut Zoning Atlas (the “Atlas”). The results are stunning. The data starkly confirms the expected, including the dominance of zoning for single-family housing (90.5\% of zoned land) over three-or-more-family zoning (2.5\% of the state), and the correlation of multi-family housing with the prevalence of people of color. It also confirms my hypothesis that zoning jurisdictions impose significant parking requirements on housing units, which has consequences for the cost of housing and the availability of land. But some results were surprising, including that two-family housing is allowed as-of-right in over a quarter of the land in the state, and that accessory dwelling units are allowed already in 92\% of towns. In general, though, the data points to a somewhat nonsensical patchwork of housing-related constraints, across a variety of jurisdictions. This Article describes the basic legal mechanics of zoning and argues it is an important area of study. It reveals that despite the importance of zoning, very few studies have conducted rigorous multi-jurisdictional surveys of actual zoning codes. The Article describes the methodology for this research, including the universe of codes reviewed, the nature of the textual analysis, the process of collecting mapping information, and the manner in which the information was translated into an interactive public interface. And it concludes with key findings, both unsurprising and surprising. The Article concludes that these findings compel state action. This represents not the end of the questions that can be addressed through the data — but the beginning of what will be ever-deepening scholarly inquiries into a unique data set, one that has the potential to improve zoning decision-making in ways that improve our response to a variety of issues, from segregation to education, economic development to deindustrialization, and the environment to public health.},

Studies show that this concentration of wealth and poverty causes several negative outcomes. Among them are poor health and high crime in areas of extreme poverty, and the concentration of regional resources in very affluent neighborhoods for richer residents. Additionally, our recently published analysis that compared Connecticut to a national study of racially concentrated affluence showed that Connecticut faces racial segregation along income lines that in many ways surpass those of other large metropolitan areas. maps of change over time from 1980 to present},

However, for both of these arguments to be true, charter schools would have to replace low-performing public schools in currently disadvantaged, but revitalizing, neighborhoods. Using data from the Chicago Public Schools, the Common Core, and the Census, we examine the neighborhood and school-level factors that account for where elementary schools closed and opened in Chicago during the late 1990s and 2000s. We find that schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods were more likely to close, but only because these were also underperforming and under-enrolled schools.

That analysis concluded that the ¾-mile long structure through the central area of Hartford while in need of immediate repairs, will also need to be fully reconstructed or replaced within 10-15 years.  A short-term repair project was recently completed and ConnDOT continues to monitor the structure, but these repairs are not considered a permanent fix.  ConnDOT recognizes there is a need to continue the planning and community involvement process for the longer-term reconstruction or replacement of the Viaduct. CRCOG managed the initial phase of the Viaduct planning process on behalf of the City, working through a committee of stakeholders entitled the HUB of Hartford.  The goal of the study was to identify several preliminary, technically sound alternatives to reconstruct, replace or remove this structure and evaluate their ability to improve the quality of life in surrounding neighborhoods, support existing businesses and promote economic development.  The final report is available in the Study Documents section below. Since the completion of the initial planning study, ConnDOT has taken the lead on the planning process.},

  abstract = {Local financing of public schools in the United States leads to a bundling of two distinct choices – residential choice and school choice – and has been argued to increase the degree of socioeconomic segregation across school districts. A school finance reform, aimed at equalization of school finances, can in principle weaken this link between housing choice and choice of schools. In this paper, we study the impacts of the Michigan school finance reform of 1994 (Proposal A) on spatial segregation. The reform was a state initiative intended to equalize per-pupil expenditures between Michigan school districts and reduce the role of local financing. We find that Proposal A was responsible for increases in the value of housing stock in the lowest-spending school districts, and for improvements in several socioeconomic indicators in these districts, implying a decline in neighborhood sorting. We also find that the reform affected dispersion of incomes and educational attainment within school districts, increasing within-district heterogeneity in the lowest-spending school districts, while decreasing the same in the highest-spending districts. However, there is continued high demand for residence in the highest-spending communities, suggesting the importance of neighborhood peer effects ("local" social capital) and implying that even a comprehensive government aid program can fail to make a large impact on residential segregation.},

I urge you to accept the invitation.''--John Merrow, education correspondent, PBS NewsHour, and president,Learning Matters, Inc.''What Our School shows with passion and precision is that education is about real people leading real lives in real places. If school doesn't engage them, it doesn t work, no matter what the accountants and policymakers may say. That's what this book is really about and why it's so important for anyone who genuinely cares about schools, communities, and their children.''--From the Foreword by Sir Ken Robinson, world-renowned author and educatorAlmost every major American city is experimenting with school choice--a deeply controversial idea that is dramatically reshaping public education. Will the wider array of school options help parents and educators identify better strategies for helping all children learn? Or will the high stakes of the marketplace end up privatizing this most public of institutions? Education activist Sam Chaltain believes that before we can answer these questions, we must put a human face on the modern landscape of teaching and learning. Our School documents a year in the life of two schools in the nation's capital--one a new charter school just opening its doors, the other a neighborhood school that first opened in 1924. Chaltain weaves together the observations and emotions of the people whose lives intersect there, and the triumphs and the challenges they experience. The result is an unsettling, complex portrayal of American public education. Our School is important reading for educational policymakers, administrators, parents, the media, and anyone who aspires to be a teacher.Book Features:* Specific recommendations for creating a healthy, high-functioning school.* A detailed account of what school choice actually looks and feels like to the people who experience it.* A vivid description of the modern classroom and what it's really like to teach in public school.* An important focus on the humanity of teachers (their personal histories, their reasons for entering the profession, their day-to-day challenges).* An intimate look at the inner lives of children (their biggest fears and needs, their moments of triumph and understanding).},

Trustees Chairman Robert Furek said the budget request -- developed by former schools chief Matthew Borrelli and endorsed by new Superintendent Anthony S. Amato -- was reasonable and necessary to turn around the troubled system. Furek said it was based on real needs, not the guesswork that had led the trustees to chop then- Superintendent Patricia Daniel'sbudget request last year. The trustees stood by a controversial redistricting plan that would close Barbour Elementary School and send its 140 students to Wish School. The plan also would send some Kennelly School students to Hooker School, some West Middle students to King and Barnard- Brown, and some Parkville and Moylan students to McDonough.

This is a textbook example of institutional bias, steering new employees to support housing trends that were created with redlining and white flight.},

  abstract = {The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment offered randomly selected families living in high- poverty housing projects housing vouchers to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods. We present new evidence on the impacts of MTO on children's long-term outcomes using administrative data from tax returns. We find that moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood significantly improves college attendance rates and earnings for children who were young (below age 13) when their families moved. These children also live in better neighborhoods themselves as adults and are less likely to become single parents. The treatment effects are substantial: children whose families take up an experimental voucher to move to a lower-poverty area when they are less than 13 years old have an annual income that is \$3,477 (31\%) higher on average relative to a mean of \$11,270 in the control group in their mid-twenties. In contrast, the same moves have, if anything, negative long-term impacts on children who are more than 13 years old when their families move, perhaps because of the disruption effects of moving to a very different environment. The gains from moving fall with the age when children move, consistent with recent evidence that the duration of exposure to a better environment during childhood is a key determinant of an individual's long-term outcomes. The findings imply that offering vouchers to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods to families with young children who are living in high- poverty housing projects may reduce the intergenerational persistence of poverty and ultimately generate positive returns for taxpayers.},

The case stems from the failed relocation of families from three federally subsidized properties in high poverty, segregated neighborhoods in the North End of Hartford – Clay Arsenal Renaissance Apartments, Barbour Gardens Apartments, and Infill I – and HUD’s decision to re-subsidize many of the units in these properties rather than subsidizing housing in higher-opportunity areas.},

  abstract = {"When Pennington finally made the move to Hartford, he became part of a highly organized and engaged African American community. African Americans, after segregated treatment, formally organized a church in 1826, which eventually became the Talcott Street Congregational Church and later Faith Congregational Church. The church’s quest for Pennington’s services as pastor began in 1838, but he declined the offer. In 1840, though, the determined Hartford congregation managed to persuade the talented minister to relocate. Once installed in the pulpit in Hartford, he pastored the church and taught in a local school for African American children. Although Hartford’s regular school system technically accepted all children, in 1830 African American parents, who disliked the treatment of their children in the regular system, requested a separate school. Parents established the North African and South African schools. They housed the first school at Talcott Street, while African American Methodists provided space for the other school. Amos Beman served as the best known of the early teachers; however, he moved on to pastor the Temple Street Church in New Haven. Politically and socially, James Mars, Henry Foster, and Ann Plato, faithful members of the church, were already formidable leaders in the community. Deacon Mars was a member of the executive committee of the Connecticut Anti-Slavery Society, while Foster led the efforts to develop a state temperance society for African Americans. Mars joined a coalition that fought to free Nancy, an enslaved woman brought from Georgia by her owner. In 1843 Reverend Pennington served as one of the Connecticut Anti-Slavery Society’s delegates to the world anti-slavery convention. At the September 2, 1840 meeting of that organization, he accepted the group’s presidency. In 1844 the talented Plato taught students in the Elm Street School. Although his eight years as pastor included a trip to England and two years on leave, Pennington plunged headlong into building up the educational and cultural life of African Americans. He knew that he was part of burgeoning leadership class. His writings for the well-respected Colored American, a leading African American newspaper published in New York, revealed his concern and passion for improving the quality of the education and facilities. Members of the state temperance society considered the newspaper “vital” to the empowerment of African Americans. In its pages, Pennington chastised parents and school committees for their failures. He urged parents to be not satisfied with the mere rudiments of education, while he suggested that school committees needed to upgrade buildings, equipment, furniture, and instructional materials. When Augustus Washington, a Dartmouth College-trained student and future daguerreotypist, came to Hartford, Pennington and his wife taught and served as administrators at a school in two rooms in his church’s lower level. Washington also became a teacher of African American children in Hartford. Although he only taught two years, he impressed Thomas Robbins, a visiting clergyman, with his skills as an educator. When Ann Plato published a collection of her writings, Pennington proudly wrote the foreword. He used her writings as proof that African Americans were capable of intellectual pursuits, not simply the drudgery of slave labor. The minister suggested that African Americans should purchase the book."},

  abstract = {This Note seeks to forge a richer understanding of the costs and benefits of zoning. To accomplish its goal, this Note assesses and critiques Andrew Cappel's A Walk Along Willow. This Note asks and answers three questions: (1) Are Cappel's findings about land use patterns replicated in areas more representative of the city? (2) Did Cappel correctly assess New Haven's initial encounter with zoning in the 1920s? and (3) Was the implementation of zoning in New Haven worthwhile? This Note quantitatively demonstrates the serious tradeoffs between government regulation and strong private property rights, and concludes that previous studies of New Haven have oversimplified the knotty problems posed by land use regulation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT] " In A Walk Along Willow, Cappel systematically measured the building setbacks, sideyards, heights, and lot coverage throughout one New Haven neighborhood, and concluded that the city's residents fashioned a complex and orderly land use system without the aid of government regulation.5 Cappel also found that (1) nuisance law effectively controlled noxious industries;6 (2) zoning regulations merely codified preexisting land use patterns;7 and (3) social norms govern many aspects of urban development.8 All of these conclusions pose serious questions about the necessity and effectiveness of zoning and other governmental land use regulations." "Unlike A Walk Along Willow, which examines only one neighborhood, my research focused on four separate neighborhoods scattered throughout New Haven: Westville, City Point, Wooster Square, and the Upper Hill. Taken together, these districts are a representative cross-section of the major working-class areas of the city during the early twentieth century18 Westville was a small, almost suburban neighborhood bordered by a handful of industries along the banks of the West River. Situated close to the harbor, City Point was home to light manufacturing concerns. Wooster Square sat at the center of the city's primary port and major railroad depot, and hosted several large manufacturing facilities. Finally, the Upper Hill neighborhood bordered the area immediately south of downtown, and was generally regarded as New Haven's poorest neighborhood. This Note will also reexamine Cappel's conclusions about the history of the adoption of zoning in New Haven. A Walk Along Willow contends that "local advocates of urban planning . . . came to dominate the discussion of land use controls, and the actual conditions of the city became increasingly irrelevant."19 According to Cappel, a small group of elites forced zoning on the public, even though the city did not require it. I will argue that Cappel's strong assertions are not based on the full spectrum of available historical documents. With this study, I hope to promote a richer, more complex understanding of New Haven's decision to create a zoned legal regime and its ultimate effect on the city's working-class residents. Ultimately, this Note presents empirical evidence that can form the basis for a new perspective on zoning. Specifically, I have set out to answer three questions: First, do Cappel's findings about the patterns of land use in the Willow-Canner strip hold up in more representative neighborhoods of New Haven? second, did Cappel correctly assess New Haven's initial encounter with zoning in the 19205? And third, was the implementation of zoning in New Haven worthwhile? I will argue that while Cappel's study provides a remarkable glimpse of spontaneous organization in an upscale neighborhood, A Walk Along Willow repeatedly oversimplifies the knotty problems posed by land use regulation."},

  abstract = {Winner of the Bancroft PrizeIn twenty-first-century America, some cities are flourishing and others are struggling, but they all must contend with deteriorating infrastructure, economic inequality, and unaffordable housing. Cities have limited tools to address these problems, and many must rely on the private market to support the public good.It wasn’t always this way. For almost three decades after World War II, even as national policies promoted suburban sprawl, the federal government underwrote renewal efforts for cities that had suffered during the Great Depression and the war and were now bleeding residents into the suburbs. In Saving America’s Cities, the prizewinning historian Lizabeth Cohen follows the career of Edward J. Logue, whose shifting approach to the urban crisis tracked the changing balance between government-funded public programs and private interests that would culminate in the neoliberal rush to privatize efforts to solve entrenched social problems. A Yale-trained lawyer, rival of Robert Moses, and sometime critic of Jane Jacobs, Logue saw renewing cities as an extension of the liberal New Deal. He worked to revive a declining New Haven, became the architect of the “New Boston” of the 1960s, and, later, led New York State’s Urban Development Corporation, which built entire new towns, including Roosevelt Island in New York City.Logue’s era of urban renewal has a complicated legacy: Neighborhoods were demolished and residents dislocated, but there were also genuine successes and progressive goals. Saving America’s Cities is a dramatic story of heartbreak and destruction but also of human idealism and resourcefulness, opening up possibilities for our own time.},

The story described Hartford as a decaying hulk of a once- grand city, now with the second highest percentage of people in poverty, just behind Brownsville, Tex. Almost 90 percent of the people in Greater Hartford live outside the city of Hartford, and enjoy good schools, nice neighborhoods, fine recreational opportunities. If Hartford were defined by its metropolitan area, instead of an 18-square-mile inner ring, we wouldn't be one of the poorest cities in the country, we'd be one of the wealthiest. Consider Jacksonville, Fla. The metro area has 1.1 million people, about the same as Hartford's. But while 120,000 people live in the 18-square-mile city of Hartford, 800,000 people live in the 841-square-mile city of Jacksonville.},

The  housing choice voucher program (formerly known as “Section 8”) is the federal government’s major program  for assisting very low-income families, the elderly, and the disabled to afford housing in the private market.  CFHC’s objective was to determine what factors influence the housing choices of low-income housing choice  voucher holders and what inhibits these residents from using their vouchers to move from struggling communities to areas with less crime, thriving schools and lower poverty rates (so-called “opportunity moves”).  This report explores how low-income people of color make their housing decisions and identifies  impediments to those who have considered, but not made, opportunity moves. The findings include a series  of recommendations from the participating voucher holders themselves about strategies for eliminating  barriers to such opportunity moves."

There are variations in teachers' ability, class sizes, curricula, instructional facilities and materials, all of which affect eh educational product, the pupil. Figures do not reflect these significant variables not do they indicated the extent to which the declining purchasing power of the dollar accounts for higher expenditures" (Jan 1953, p2) History of State General Aid Formula (January 1965, p2) "The basis for distributing State general aid to help towns and cities finance the current expenses of public schools has undergone major changes since school year 1944-45. That year, the State's general aid was distributed thorugh a variety of 17 grants. In school year 1945-46, an additional grant [Public Law 183]was provided for the purposses of enabling all towns and cities to bring school expenditures up to a required 'minimum program' of \$100 per pupil." "A revision of the State aid laws in 1947 abolished the 17 grants and replaced them with a single grant, the formula for which constitutes the basis of distributing aid from 1947-48 through 1952-53. In 1947-48, the 'minimum program' to qulaify for State general aid was increased to \$140 per pupl. The 1953 Gneeral Assemb added an across-the-board grant of \$4 per pupil for 1953-54 and 1954-55. The grant per pupil was revised upward by the 1955 General Assembly, effective for teh school years 1955-56 and 1956-57. In 1956-57 the required 'minimum program' was increased to \$200 per pupil. Another upward revision of the grant formula was approved in 1957, effective for the years 1957-58 through 1960-61. The 1961 Gen Assemb again revised the grant formula upward for school years 1961-62 and 1962-63, and raised the required 'minimum program' to \$250 per pupil in 1961-62 and \$300 per pupil in 1962-63."

In this policy briefing, the Connecticut School Finance Project examines how Connecticut’s peer states fund their public schools and how they account for the larger costs associated with educating students with greater learning needs, such as low-income students and English Language Learners (ELLs). The policy briefing examines the public school funding systems for the other New England states (Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont), as well as three nearby mid-eastern states (New Jersey, New York, and Maryland). The briefing also compares the funding systems for these states to Connecticut’s school funding system. All of the states examined adjust state education aid to districts to provide additional resources for low-income students and students with disabilities, and nearly all do so for ELLs. However, the details of these adjustments vary significantly.},

  abstract = {This document describes viable options to enable the State of Connecticut to provide integrated and quality education, in response to a 1988 report that presented broad-based recommendations for overcoming racial inequalities in contiguous school districts. The initial report, dramatizing the increasing racial and economic isolation in the state's public schools and calling for voluntary action to reverse the trend, generated public interest and investigation of alternatives by a number of school districts, agencies, and community groups. However, despite the increasing public awareness of and responsiveness to the problem, racial and economic isolation persists. The following existing integration initiatives are described and examples of improvements are suggested: (1) Interdistrict Cooperative Grants Program (including both planning and implementation grants); (2) Project Concern, an intercommunity program for disadvantaged students; (3) State Summer School Grant Program; (4) published under Commissioner Gerald Tirozzi},

  abstract = {This report finds that the exclusion of thousands of students with disabilities from reported Connecticut Mastery Test results has distorted reported trends in test scores. Following test scores from year to year in the same grade, the study finds that statewide improvements in standard Connecticut Mastery Test (CMT) scores reported by the Connecticut State Department of Education (SDE) between 2008 and 2009 -- the period of the largest reported gains -- were largely the result of the exclusion of students with disabilities from these standard test results, rather than overall improvements in performance. For example, 84\% of the reported improvement in 4th grade math proficiency between 2008 and 2009 and 69\% of the improvement in 8th grade reading proficiency could be attributed to the exclusion of these students. Much of the reported improvements in later years could also be attributed to this exclusion, though there were some modest overall gains as well. In 2009, state and federal policy changes enabled school districts to offer a modified assessment (MAS) to students with disabilities that the districts determined would not have passed the CMT in math and/or reading. As a result of these policy changes, the share of students taking the regular CMT declined substantially. Prior to 2009, students who did not reach the proficient level on the CMT because of their disabilities were included in statewide CMT results. In 2009, thousands of low-scoring students were assigned to take the MAS test instead of the standard CMT, and these students were not included in the CMT results. Thus, CMT scores reported by the State Department of Education appeared to improve in large part because these low-scoring students were no longer included in the calculations.},

  abstract = {This analysis of enrollment in Connecticut’s school choice programs raises concerns about their relative compliance with established goals of racial and ethnic integration and equal access for all students.  Many of Connecticut’s school choice programs fall short in advancing the goal of racial and ethnic integration.  In spite of state laws requiring charter and magnet schools to reduce racial and ethnic isolation of students, only interdistrict magnet schools are typically integrated, and a majority of the state’s charter schools are highly segregated.  The report also raises concerns about the underrepresentation in school choice programs of students who do not speak English as a first language and students with special education needs. The analysis examines the demographics of students in Connecticut’s interdistrict school choice programs – programs that permit parents to enroll their children in schools outside their local school districts.  It focuses on magnet, charter, and technical schools.  Among the key findings: While both charter and interdistrict magnet schools are required by state law to reduce racial and ethnic segregation of students, only magnet schools are held to a measurable standard – a student body between 25\% and 75\% students of color. A majority of interdistrict magnet schools (62\%) meet this standard. By contrast, a majority of charter schools (65\%) are highly segregated, enrolling over 90\% students of color.  While technical schools have no measurable integration standard, a majority (56\%) would meet the requirement for magnet schools. Students who do not speak English as a first language are under-represented in Connecticut’s school choice programs, compared to the school districts of the towns in which the programs are located.  A majority of all interdistrict magnet, charter, and technical schools enroll students identified as being English Language Learners (ELL) at a substantially lower rate (five percentage points lower) than the local school districts of the towns in which they are located.  Over one-third of magnet and charter schools and a majority of technical schools enroll students identified as requiring special education at a substantially lower rate (five percentage points lower) than the local school districts of the towns in which they are located.},

  abstract = {The practice of using free and reduced price meal (FRPM) eligibility as a proxy for poverty is pervasive in educational research and policymaking. More thorough consideration of the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) makes at least one thing clear: the statistics help us understand how many students are eligible for the program, but they have considerable limitations when used as an indicator of student need or socioeconomic status: Eligibility for free or reduced price meals does not entirely capture a student’s access (or lack of access) to economic resources such as parental income, education level, and family wealth. The combined percentage of students eligible for free and reduced meals does not show income differences between the two income categories. Districts and schools that have the same combined percentage of students eligible for FRPM may have substantial differences in the percentage of their students that are eligible for free meals. Participation rates in the NSLP may vary based on different certification procedures at the district level. The Connecticut Education Data and Research website collects and reports FRPM data differently from the State Department of Education Bureau of Health, Nutrition, Family Services, and Adult Education. Thus, there are at least two sources of FRPM data with different numbers of eligible students reported for the same schools and districts. We recommend caution in using FRPM statistics and consideration of alternative measures to indicate student need and/or socioeconomic status.},

  abstract = {Using an alternate measure of educational progress – vertical scale scores – can present a different picture of change over time in the performance of Connecticut students. Each summer, the state reports the results of the Connecticut Mastery Test (CMT), by showing what percent of students scored at five different levels: below basic, basic, proficient, goal, and advanced.  These types of “standards-based” levels are the most widely cited measures of educational progress in Connecticut and will take on increasing importance in the Governor and General Assembly’s recent education law. However, standards-based reporting may miss improvement that occurs within levels and does not explain improvement over time on different grade-level tests within a subject area.  Therefore, the State Department of Education developed an additional improvement indicator in 2007 -- vertical scale scores. Vertical scales allow us to understand how students perform on the state tests of math or reading in one grade compared to the next grade, despite more difficult and different math content.  Vertical scale scores are a rough indicator of improvement on the standard CMT from one year to the next, following the same group, or matched cohort, of children. This report, which looks at the value and limitations of standards-based and vertical scale CMT measures, finds that On average, students are making progress on the vertical scales on the standard CMT in math and reading, even though this growth may not be reflected on the standards-based level reports. Racial and ethnic minority and low-income students had lower vertical scale scores, on average, than white and more affluent students in 3rd grade math and reading, the first year that the standard Connecticut Mastery Test is administered to students.  Within racial and ethnic groups, children from lower-income families (eligible for free and reduced price meals) tend to score lower on the vertical scale scores in third grade. Despite different starting points, black, Latino, English Language Learning students, and students with disabilities on average experienced a comparable amount of growth or improvement on the standard CMT in math and reading from one year-grade 3 in 2009 -- to the next-grade 4 in 2010 -- compared to the statewide average.},

A quality public education system should provide a well-rounded, balanced curriculum and help prepare children for their adult lives. While Connecticut has a strong public education system, we need better ways to assess our children’s learning and the work that schools perform.  This brief for electoral candidates makes several recommendations to improve and broaden educational opportunities: Public education should support a broad set of goals for children’s development and well-being. The state’s educational system should continue to provide a broad educational program that serves all children’s learning and developmental needs including academic skills, critical thinking, the arts and literature, preparation for skilled work, social skills, citizenship, and emotional health. Use a variety of methods and indicators, in addition to standardized tests, to assess whether children receive a quality education. Require schools to adopt initiatives that promote a positive school climate and to regularly report on their suspension, truancy and attrition rates. The ECS funding must keep pace with students’ need in the coming years.},

The desegregation program, Project Concern in Hartford, Connecticut, began in 1966 by randomly selecting one group of students to be offered the opportunity to attend suburban schools and a second group as controls. Both groups, along with other Project Concern participants, were traced. In 1982, some 700 students and their parents were surveyed, after they had finished secondary school. It was concluded that attending suburban schools reduced high school dropout rates, increased adult contacts with whites socially, and increased the number of blacks choosing to live in interracial housing. Male participants had fewer difficulties with police, perceived less discrimination in colleges and in employment, and were more likely to succeed in college. Female participants were less likely to have a child before age 18. It seems likely that, for a male, the chance of obtaining 2 or more years of college was at least one and one-half times greater if he received a desegregated education. Appendix A discusses data collection methodology, and Appendix B is an analysis of self-selection and response bias.},

The students were nearly all non-Hispanic American blacks, and a few were of Puerto Rican or West Indian ancestry. The main finding was that the desegregated black students obtained different types of employment than did the students in the control group. The desegregated students are now working in occupations which are less commonly held by blacks: for instance, men are salesmen rather than postmen, while women are secretaries rather than nurses' aides.

Not merely institutions of learning, schools have increasingly become a sign of a neighborhood’s vitality, and city planners have ever more explicitly promoted “good schools” as a means of attracting more affluent families to urban areas, a dynamic process that Maia Bloomfield Cucchiara critically examines in \emph{Marketing Schools, Marketing Cities}.{$<$}/div{$><$}div{$>~<$}/div{$><$}div{$>$}Focusing on Philadelphia’s Center City Schools Initiative, she shows how education policy makes overt attempts to prevent, or at least slow, middle-class flight to the suburbs. Navigating complex ethical terrain, she balances the successes of such policies in strengthening urban schools and communities against the inherent social injustices they propagate—the further marginalization and disempowerment of lowerclass families. By asking what happens when affluent parents become “valued customers,” \emph{Marketing Schools, Marketing Cities} uncovers a problematic relationship between public institutions and private markets, where the former are used to leverage the latter to effect urban transformations.},

  abstract = {This article examines an effort to use urban schools to promote the revitalization of a large northeastern city in the United States. In order to attract and retain professional families to a regenerated central city, downtown schools are re‐branded and promoted to such families as suitable for their children. The article draws on interviews and observation in a particular downtown elementary school to examine the experiences of different groups of parents in this new educational market. The data reveal how middle‐ and upper‐class parents are treated as sought‐after customers who gain and retain positions of influence over the direction of the school once their children are admitted. However, the same processes marginalize low‐income and minority parents. The article concludes that while the goals of the policy may be ostensibly worthy, one of its consequences is to reinscribe existing status positions and inequalities.},

Rowland had signed 236 bills as of Wednesday and vetoed two, his office said. The lottery bill, which will restructure the state's \$700 million- a-year gaming enterprise as a quasi-governmental corporation with its own board of directors, is significantly scaled down from a proposal Rowland announced in January to sell 6 percent of the lottery to private investors. That proposal met with stiff opposition from lawmakers and was defeated by a legislative committee in March.},

  abstract = {Research on the housing choice voucher program and housing mobility interventions shows that even with assistance, it is difficult for poor minority families to relocate to, and remain in, low-poverty neighborhoods. Scholars suggest that both structural forces and individual preferences help explain these residential patterns. However, less attention is paid towhere preferences come from, and how they respond to policies and social structure to shape residential decisionmaking. In this paper, we use data from fieldwork with 110 participants in the Baltimore Mobility Program (BMP), an assisted mobility voucher program, to demonstrate how residential preferences can shift over time as a function of living in higher opportunity neighborhoods. Since 2003, BMP has helped over 2,000 low-income African American families move from high-poverty, highly segregated neighborhoods in Baltimore City to low-poverty, racially mixed neighborhoods throughout the Baltimore region. Along with intensive counseling and unique program administration, these new neighborhood contexts helped many women to shift what we term residential choice frameworks: the criteria that families use to assess housing and neighborhoods. Parents who participated in the mobility program raised their expectations for what neighborhoods, homes, and schools can provide for their children and themselves. Parents report new preferences for the “quiet” of suburban locations, and strong consideration of school quality and neighborhood diversity when thinking about where to live. Our findings suggest that housing policies should employ counseling to ensure relocation to and sustained residence in low-poverty communities. Our work also underscores how social structure, experience, and policy opportunities influence preferences, and how these preferences, in turn, affect policy outcomes.},

Choice advocates charge that choice will improve access to quality schools for disadvantaged minority students (Chubb \& Moe 1990; Coons \& Sugarman, 1978; Godwin \& Kemerer, 2002; Viteritti, 1999). Critics argue that choice is unlikely to benefit minority students, but they are divided as to why this may be the case. Some maintain that unfettered choice leads to racial segregation (Henig, 1996; Mickelson, 2005; Saporito, 2003); others maintain that while choice may be successful in reducing segregation at the building level, choice programs may be problematic to the extent that they segregate schools at the classroom level (Wells \& Crain, 1997; Wells, Holme, \& Vasudeva, 2000; Wells \& Roda, 2009; West, 1994). I use data from the eighth-grade wave of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study to examine these questions. Results indicate that the racial composition of magnet schools is not statistically different from regular public schools; however, magnet schools are more heterogeneous at the classroom level, but only with respect to White/Hispanic racial composition. In particular, honors classes in magnet schools are significantly more diverse than honors classes in regular public schools, but only with regard to White/Hispanic diversity.},

Utilizing an Advocacy Coalition Framework, questions about the ideological motivations behind different forms of school choice, the particular programs that certain groups are likely to support or oppose, and the strategies—including the potential alliances and coalitions—that are increasingly employed around school choice policy are explored. A framework for understanding and analyzing policymaking in this area is offered, extending existing thinking on both school choice issues and education policy more generally.},

As public Montessori schools expand rapidly as alternatives to traditional public schools, the story of these schools, Debs points out, is a microcosm of the broader conflicts around public school choice.  Drawing on historical research, interviews with public Montessori educators, and ethnographic case studies, Debs explores the forces that pull intentionally diverse, progressive schools toward elitism. At the heart of Debs's book is a thoughtful analysis of the notion of "fit" between parents and schools--an idea that is central to school choice, which is often marketed as an opportunity for parents to find the perfect fit for their kids. By exploring parents' varied motivations in choosing these schools and observing how families experience--or fail to experience--a "good fit" after having chosen a particular school, Debs makes an original contribution to the literature on school choice and sheds light on the dilemmas entailed in maintaining diversity in progressive charter and magnet schools.},

  abstract = {Background/Context: Prior research overlooks the importance of drawing distinctions within the category of defaulters or "nonchoosers" in schooling choices. Defaulters are both a theoretically and empirically interesting population, and understanding the processes by which families come to or are assigned the default school offers insight into the micromechanisms contributing to the reproduction of inequality through education. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: In this study, I use in-depth interview data to understand defaulting and propose a basic framework that gets beyond a chooser/nonchooser dichotomy. The purpose of this work is to help researchers and school district officials to identify areas of school choice systems that are incompatible with would-be choosers. This study further offers a useful framework for thinking about defaulters and their role in the school choice process. Population/Participants/Subjects: This study draws from survey and interview data from 28 low-income to working-class African American parents in the Chicago Public Schools whose children were at a choice juncture (the transition from eighth grade to high school). Data Collection and Analysis: This study utilizes survey and in-depth qualitative interviews. Surveys and interviews were conducted in person and lasted from 30 minutes to 2 hours each. Parent respondents filled out a survey that included demographic information, family and child activities, community connectedness, and basic activity around choosing a high school and then answered open-ended questions about their specific choice activities, their ideas about education, and their information networks. I employed inductive coding to analyze the interview data. Findings/Results: In this study, I find that families who arrived at the default outcome did so in ways that followed patterns similar to those found in studies of choosers. Families' inclination to choose, capacity for choice, and school preferences, as well external barriers, compose a framework that helps to explain how some parents labeled as "nonchoosers" or defaulters in other studies are actually actively engaging in the choice process and, further, how the choice process itself can lead those who perceive themselves as choosers to be classified by researchers as nonchoosers or defaulters. Conclusions/Recommendations: The defaulter framework provides insight into the barriers that some families face to active choosing and, as such, suggests potential micro- and macro-level interventions to meet the needs of a variety of potential types of participants in choice systems.},

To complement existing work, we assess research on the educational and social outcomes for comparable youth who change school and neighborhood settings through unique housing policy and school voucher programs. Research shows that housing programs have helped poor families move to much safer, less disadvantaged, and less segregated neighborhoods. Some housing programs have also provided early educational benefits for young people who relocated to less poor and less segregated neighborhoods, but these gains were not maintained in the long run. School voucher programs have helped disadvantaged youth attend higher-performing private schools in less segregated environments with more middle-class peers. Although some voucher programs have shown small positive effects, the results of others are less certain owing to methodological weaknesses. Future research should directly examine families’ selection processes and be cautious with quantitative research that uses naturally occurring variation to model the effects of potential social programs. Researchers should also recognize the family processes that interact with social policy to determine how youth development can be improved, alongside the structural and political processes that condition how programs work at a larger scale.},

In this article, we argue that the changing nature of suburban schools and communities, and the history of their creation as education spaces, make them advantageous locations for education researchers to study many pressing issues and expand the ways we understand the intersections of race, place and inequality. We argue that education scholarship across multiple disciplinary orientations, theoretical foci, and substantive concerns can benefit from a deeper engagement with suburban education spaces and the issues and opportunities associated with them.},

  abstract = {Is antisemitism on the rise in America? Did the "hymietown" comment by Jesse Jackson and the Crown Heights riot signal a resurgence of antisemitism among blacks? The surprising answer to both questions, according to Leonard Dinnerstein, is no--Jews have never been more at home in America. But what we are seeing today, he writes, are the well-publicized results of a long tradition of prejudice, suspicion, and hatred against Jews--the direct product of the Christian teachings underlying so much of America's national heritage. In Antisemitism in America, Leonard Dinnerstein provides a landmark work--the first comprehensive history of prejudice against Jews in the United States, from colonial times to the present. His richly documented book traces American antisemitism from its roots in the dawn of the Christian era and arrival of the first European settlers, to its peak during World War II and its present day permutations--with separate chapters on antisemititsm in the South and among African-Americans, showing that prejudice among both whites and blacks flowed from the same stream of Southern evangelical Christianity. He shows, for example, that non-Christians were excluded from voting (in Rhode Island until 1842, North Carolina until 1868, and in New Hampshire until 1877), and demonstrates how the Civil War brought a new wave of antisemitism as both sides assumed that Jews supported with the enemy. We see how the decades that followed marked the emergence of a full-fledged antisemitic society, as Christian Americans excluded Jews from their social circles, and how antisemetic fervor climbed higher after the turn of the century, accelerated by eugenicists, fear of Bolshevism, the publications of Henry Ford, and the Depression. Dinnerstein goes on to explain that just before our entry into World War II, antisemitism reached a climax, as Father Coughlin attacked Jews over the airwaves (with the support of much of the Catholic clergy) and Charles Lindbergh delivered an openly antisemitic speech to an isolationist meeting. After the war, Dinnerstein tells us, with fresh economic opportunities and increased activities by civil rights advocates, antisemititsm went into sharp decline--though it frequently appeared in shockingly high places, including statements by Nixon and his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "It must also be emphasized," Dinnerstein writes, "that in no Christian country has antisemitism been weaker than it has been in the United States," with its traditions of tolerance, diversity, and a secular national government. This book, however, reveals in disturbing detail the resilience, and vehemence, of this ugly prejudice. Penetrating, authoritative, and frequently alarming, this is the definitive account of a plague that refuses to go away.},

In profiles of four leading activists, he reveals how different generations redefined the meaning of the Brown decision over time to fit the historical conditions of their particular struggles. William Kelley of the Urban League worked to win teaching jobs for blacks and to resettle Southern black migrant children in the 1950s; Lloyd Barbee of the NAACP organized protests in support of integrated schools and the teaching of black history in the 1960s; and Marian McEvilly and Howard Fuller contested--in different ways--the politics of implementing desegregation in the 1970s, paving the way for the 1990s private school voucher movement. Dougherty concludes by contrasting three interpretations of the progress made in the fifty years since Brown, showing how historical perspective can shed light on contemporary debates over race and education reform.},

Overall, while both test scores and race explain home prices, we found that the influence of tests declined while race became nearly seven times more influential over our decade-long period of study.

We created SmartChoices, a public school search tool for the Hartford, Connecticut region, conducted parent workshops (with hands-on instruction in English and Spanish) to narrow the digital divide, and collected quantitative and qualitative data to investigate how it influenced their decision-making processes. Based on our small sample of ninety-three workshop participants, we found that two-thirds either clarified or changed their top-ranked school after receiving guidance on using the website. Furthermore, several also found what they defined as "better" schools (with higher test scores or more racially-balanced student populations) that were located closer to their neighborhood than their initial top-rated choices. But making information more widely available is not a neutral act, as some parents used our search tool to avoid schools with high concentrations of students from racial groups other than their own. Overall, this study contributes to the scholarly literature that views school choice as a double-edged sword, with potentially positive outcomes for some families and negative consequences for others left behind.},

At the same time, educational historians have focused so intently on the rise and decline of big-city school systems that they have largely failed to account for suburbanization. This article seeks to bridge the gap by examining the rising practice of “shopping for schools,” the buying and selling of private homes to gain access to more desirable public school attendance zones. This case study of three communities near Hartford, Connecticut, traces the convergence of real estate interests, suburban homebuyers, and government officials, particularly as the postwar labor market increasingly rewarded higher levels of educational attainment. Shopping for schools not only brings together educational credentialism and suburban consumerism but also helps to explain increasing stratification among suburbs in recent decades.

Report 1 offers a statistical analysis of RSCO applicants versus non-applicants among 6,673 Hartford-resident students enrolled in Hartford Public Schools (HPS) — both district schools and interdistrict magnet schools — from grades 3 through 7 in Spring 2012. Overall, we found that participation in the RSCO application process was not random, but linked to student socioeconomic characteristics that often showed higher participation by more privileged families. In this sample, there were statistically significant lower levels of RSCO participation among English Language Learners and those with special needs, and generally higher levels by students with high CMT scores, and those who live in census areas with higher median household incomes and higher percentages of owner-occupied housing. The report also evaluates statistically significant differences and the magnitude of numbers of expected versus actual applicants by race and ethnicity, school performance, location, and other characteristics.},

  abstract = {Which Hartford and suburban families were more (or less) likely to apply to the Regional School Choice Office for public school choice options such as interdistrict magnet schools, and how do these families vary by student characteristics \& achievement, school composition, and neighborhood/town demographics? Report 2 offers a statistical analysis of 17,710 applicants to the Spring 2013 RSCO lottery, matched to a broader pool of over 170,000 potential applicants from the RSCO transportation region in the Public School Information System (PSIS) database.  Overall, this report expands on our prior finding that in Report 1 that participation in the RSCO application process was not random, but linked to certain characteristics. Among Hartford-resident K-11 students, English Language Learners were much less likely to apply (26 percent fewer students than expected), those with special education needs were somewhat less likely to apply (16 percent fewer than expected), and those living in higher-income or higher-homeownership areas were more likely to apply (24 and 28 percent more students than expected, respectively). Regarding test score differences, Hartford applicants had slightly higher reading scores than non-applicants, but this disparity was small and was not found in any other subject areas. Along racial lines, we found that Hartford Black students were more likely to apply (11 percent more than expected), while Hispanic students were less likely (8 percent fewer than expected), with no difference for White students. Among suburban K-11 students, those from lower-income families were more likely to apply (43 percent more than expected). Black suburban students were much more likely to apply (169 percent more than expected), and Hispanic suburban students were more likely to apply (48 percent more than expected), while White suburban students were less likely to apply (47 percent fewer than expected). Students in suburbs with more than 60 percent minority enrollment were far more likely to apply (132 percent more students than expected). Regarding achievement tests, higher-scoring suburban students were less likely to apply (12 percent fewer students than expected).},

What would happen, Cohen asks, if we reversed this flow and “embraced the genres of the open web?” How might the web challenge prevailing norms of scholarly work, particularly in how we generate and communicate knowledge with one another? This, in short, is what we seek to explore in our Writing History volume.},

  abstract = {As the incomes of affluent and poor families have diverged over the past three decades, so too has the educational performance of their children. But how exactly do the forces of rising inequality affect the educational attainment and life chances of low-income children? In Whither Opportunity? a distinguished team of economists, sociologists, and experts in social and education policy examines the corrosive effects of unequal family resources, disadvantaged neighborhoods, insecure labor markets, and worsening school conditions on K-12 education. This groundbreaking book illuminates the ways rising inequality is undermining one of the most important goals of public education—the ability of schools to provide children with an equal chance at academic and economic success. The most ambitious study of educational inequality to date, Whither Opportunity? analyzes how social and economic conditions surrounding schools affect school performance and children’s educational achievement. The book shows that from earliest childhood, parental investments in children’s learning affect reading, math, and other attainments later in life. Contributor Meredith Phillip finds that between birth and age six, wealthier children will have spent as many as 1,300 more hours than poor children on child enrichment activities such as music lessons, travel, and summer camp. Greg Duncan, George Farkas, and Katherine Magnuson demonstrate that a child from a poor family is two to four times as likely as a child from an affluent family to have classmates with low skills and behavior problems – attributes which have a negative effect on the learning of their fellow students. As a result of such disparities, contributor Sean Reardon finds that the gap between rich and poor children’s math and reading achievement scores is now much larger than it was fifty years ago. And such income-based gaps persist across the school years, as Martha Bailey and Sue Dynarski document in their chapter on the growing income-based gap in college completion.Whither Opportunity? also reveals the profound impact of environmental factors on children’s educational progress and schools’ functioning. Elizabeth Ananat, Anna Gassman-Pines, and Christina Gibson-Davis show that local job losses such as those caused by plant closings can lower the test scores of students with low socioeconomic status, even students whose parents have not lost their jobs. They find that community-wide stress is most likely the culprit. Analyzing the math achievement of elementary school children, Stephen Raudenbush, Marshall Jean, and Emily Art find that students learn less if they attend schools with high student turnover during the school year – a common occurrence in poor schools. And David Kirk and Robert Sampson show that teacher commitment, parental involvement, and student achievement in schools in high-crime neighborhoods all tend to be low.For generations of Americans, public education provided the springboard to upward mobility. This pioneering volume casts a stark light on the ways rising inequality may now be compromising schools’ functioning, and with it the promise of equal opportunity in America.},

The ability to use two or more languages promotes cognitive flexibility, improves attention processes and has been shown to delay the onset of Alzheimer's and dementia in old age. The very bad news is that as this research comes to light, educational policy in U.S. schools is moving away from bilingualism. Since the late 1990s, a movement to restrict the use of languages other than English in instruction has gained ascendance, resulting in bans on bilingual instruction in three states so far — California, Arizona and Massachusetts — and the curtailing of bilingual education in many other states.},

All three panelists express pleasure with the results of the summer program and optimism for the fall. Their discussion is punctuated with interviews with black and white families whose daughters participated in the summer program; footage of a workshop session to prepare parents for the fall busing plan; and comments from two teachers who participated in the summer session and one teacher who would participate in the two-year project.

  abstract = {The otherwise quiet, uneventful city-suburb of Eden Prairie, MN erupted last year after educators proposed a new school assignment map designed to reduce racial and economic segregation. This former farming community quickly became the poster child for the racially and culturally shifting suburban landscape and a harbinger of storms to come. What differentiates Eden Prairie from the dozens, if not hundreds, of places similarly situated, is that educators here refused to cave under pressure from an organized, privileged class who saw no reason to mess with a “neighborhood school” organization that incorporated economic and racial segregation into its design. In this Story from the Field, we learn that courage and flexibility may be the qualities educators in the changing American suburb need most of all. But in the long term, unless state and national government leaders affirm a vision of integration and develop clear plans for achieving it, forward thinking suburban educators like Eden Prairie’s will be left on their own and unjustly vulnerable as they face some of the most vexing challenges of our time.},

  abstract = {Our current school funding system often bolsters school district boundaries between rich and poor, holding resources in wealthy communities and keeping low-income students from accessing broader opportunities. In June, The Supreme Court decided Texas v. Inclusive Communities Project, affirming that no government policy, even one without discriminatory intent, may create “artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers” for minority individuals and families seeking quality housing in a good neighborhood. However, one kind of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barrier continues to separate families—often poor and minority families—from places of opportunity: school-district boundaries. In the United States, the public school a student attends is still primarily determined by where their family lives. Most children are enrolled in district schools that receive, on average, nearly half of their funding through local property taxes. This system ties school budgets to the value of local property wealth and incentivizes boundaries between upper- and lower-income communities. Intentional or not, these invisible walls often concentrate education dollars within affluent school districts, and ensure that low-income students are kept on the outside. This map, which shows student poverty levels within the more than 13,000 school districts in the United States, begins to paint a picture of this phenomenon: school districts drawn in odd shapes and sizes, many sitting next to—or even inside of—districts of wildly different means},

At the risk of sounding defensive, this is not a fair picture of a work in progress. The article's author dwelled exclusively on the empty half of the glass. Indeed, it has been stated on these pages many times that Hartford -- and by extension, Connecticut -- would benefit from more regional cooperation, including revenue sharing among towns in Greater Hartford. The need for property tax reform has been obvious for at least a decade. The switch to a strong mayor and more cooperation among political factions on the city council are keys to accountability in city government. Sure, the statistical snapshot of Hartford is quite a contrast to the Gilded Age when Sam Colt, [Mark Twain] and other of Hartford's notable citizens chose to live and work here. The hotbed of industry that produced revolvers, sewing machines, typewriters and bicycles is definitely not the place it used to be.},

  abstract = {Municipal zoning, shockingly, may be the most consequential regulatory program in the United States. The Article develops metrics for measuring the extent to which a locality’s zoning practices are exclusionary, that is, limit the possible construction of least-cost housing. It applies the metrics to actual zoning ordinances and zoning maps, materials that legal scholars have seldom closely appraised. The municipalities chosen for study lie in three metropolitan areas, the ones listed in the Article’s title. Of the three, zoning in Greater Austin, one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the United States, is — to no one’s surprise — the most conducive to housing development. Austin suburbs have less large-lot zoning, more small-lot zoning, and fewer restrictions on the construction of multifamily housing. House prices in Silicon Valley, now commonly ten times the national median, were only slightly above the median in 1970. The extreme escalation of Silicon Valley housing prices has stemmed in significant part from its suburbs’ multifaceted efforts, after 1970, to limit further densification. Some towns in Greater New Haven, by contrast, adopted exclusionary policies as early as the 1930s. These towns’ enactments have distorted the region’s urban form and reduced its agglomeration efficiencies, but had little effect on housing prices. The Article surveys the zoning histories of the three regions, introducing, in due course, issues such as water supply, the structure of local government law, and racial demography. The final parts of the Article are more overtly normative. They present the case for boosting permitted residential densities in urban areas of the United States. To counter neighborhood NIMBYism, state legislatures should either preempt local discretion over what can be built, or reward localities that allow denser housing.},

CREC Magnet Schools continue to educate a student body that is more racially diverse than the student population statewide, and educates a higher percentage of economically disadvantaged students as compared to the state as a whole. While the state struggles with the achievement gap between white and black and Hispanic students, and between economically disadvantaged and non-economically disadvantaged students, the CREC Magnet Schools have demonstrated improvements for all student subgroups on both the CMT and CAPT, as well as smaller disparities in the achievement between subgroups as compared to the state. These achievements have occurred in spite of the fact that many students do not have a complete K-12 education within the CREC system because enrollment in a CREC magnet school is based on a lottery system.

The CREC magnet schools educate a student body that is more racially diverse than the student population statewide, and educates a higher percentage of economically disadvantaged students as compared to the state as a whole. While the state struggles with the achievement gap between white and black and Hispanic students, and between poor and non-poor students, the CREC magnet schools have demonstrated significant improvements for all student subgroups on both the CMT and CAPT},

  abstract = {"Student mobility has historically presented a challenge to schools across the country. Students who are mobile experience breaks in instruction, inconsistent curricula, and ultimately a potential for decreased academic achievement. Understanding the extent to which a school or district student population is mobile can lead educational policy makers and leaders to implement strategies to support these particular students so that they do not experience an academic downturn, therefore access to mobility data is critical. Using data from the Connecticut State Department of Education, this research study examines the degree to which student mobility exists within Connecticut, and analyzes student mobility in relation to student achievement. Implications for policy and suggestions for further research are provided." Author's current name is Sarah Vocca, CREC research director; previously CSDE Bureau Chief for Data Collection, Research, Evalaution},

Are white Americans avoiding racially mixed neighborhoods because they do not want to live with nonwhites? And if so, is this the case independent of factors with which race is associated, such as crime levels or housing values? An over-the-telephone factorial experiment addresses these issues, measuring variables that shape white Americans' choice of purchasing a home. Based on a national, random-digit-dial survey of 1,663 white Americans, the effects of African American, Asian, and Hispanic neighborhood composition on whites' likelihood of buying a house are explored, as well as the other variables for which race may serve as a proxy. Results indicate that Asian and Hispanic neighborhood composition do not matter to whites. Black neighborhood composition, however, does matter, and matters even more for white Americans with children under age 18. The effect of black composition is net of the variables that whites offer as the primary reasons they do not want to live with blacks. The implications of these findings for segregation trends and for future research are considered.},

  abstract = {Background/Context: In the first half of the 20th century, American policy makers at all levels of government, alongside housing and real estate industry figures, crafted mechanisms of racial exclusion that helped to segregate metropolitan residential landscapes. Although educators and historians have recognized the long-term consequences of these policies for the making of educational segregation, they have not yet fully perceived how strongly ideas about public schools mattered in the shaping of these exclusionary practices. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This historical study examines the "neighborhood unit" concept, its origins, and its influence, to illustrate the centrality of schooling in shaping mechanisms of racial segregation. The "neighborhood unit" concept, advocated during the 1920s by planner Clarence Perry before becoming central to local-level planning as well as federal-level housing policy, imagined self-contained communities within cities. Each of the units featured multi-purpose school-community facilities at their literal spatial as well as conceptual center. Perry and the influential cadre of planners who adopted the concept thought it would make metropolitan areas more livable, vibrant, and socially cohesive. But their neighborhood unit idea also encouraged racial segregation, in both schools and residential areas. Research Design: Sources for this qualitative historical investigation include published and unpublished primary sources from individuals, organizations, and government entities involved in making and using the idea of the neighborhood unit as well as extant historical scholarship. Conclusions/Recommendations: The history of the neighborhood unit shows that ideas about schools were central in the creation of the modern metropolitan landscape and enduring patterns of racial segregation. This evidence furthers the growing historical interpretation that housing segregation and school segregation operate not as separate terrain, but in deep connection with one another. By acknowledging and incorporating this historical perspective, educators and policy makers can reconceptualize segregation's roots, and perhaps its remedies.},

  abstract = {Slavery in the South has been documented in volumes ranging from exhaustive histories to bestselling novels. But the North's profit from---indeed, dependence on---slavery has mostly been a shameful and well-kept secret ... until now. In this startling and superbly researched new book, three veteran New England journalists demythologize the region of America know for tolerance and liberation, revealing a place where thousands of people were held in bondage and slavery was both an economic dynamo and a necessary way of life.   Complicity reveals the cruel truth about the Triangle Trade of molasses, rum, and slaves that lucratively linked the North to the West Indies and Africa; discloses the reality of Northern empires built on profits from rum, cotton, and ivory---and run, in some cases, by abolitionists; and exposes the thousand-acre plantations that existed in towns such as Salem, Connecticut. Here, too, are eye-opening accounts of the individuals who profited directly from slavery far from the Mason-Dixon line---including Nathaniel Gordon of Maine, the only slave trader sentenced to die in the United States, who even as an inmate of New York's infamous Tombs prison was supported by a shockingly large percentage of the city; Patty Cannon, whose brutal gang kidnapped free blacks from Northern states and sold them into slavery; and the Philadelphia doctor Samuel Morton, eminent in the ninteenth-century field of "race science," which purported to prove the inferiority of African-born black people.   Culled from long-ignored documents and reports---and bolstered by rarely seen photos, publications, maps, and period drawings---Complicity is a fascinating and sobering work that actually does what so many books pretend to do: shed light on America's past. Expanded from the celebrated Hartford Courant special report that the Connecticut Department of Education sent to every middle school and high school in the state (the original work is required readings in many college classrooms,) this new book is sure to become a must-read reference everywhere.},

West Hartford, compiled in honor of the town's sesquicentennial, showcases its history from earliest settlement to more recent happenings, including the 2003 Cow Parade. With more than two hundred photographs, many previously unpublished, West Hartford recalls the past of this interesting community and celebrates its present. The Central Theater marquee survives, while Burnham's grocery, the Elm Theater, and the West Hartford Lanes, all pictured in these pages, are only memories. Other landmarks, such as the Quaker Lane Diner, the Woman's Exchange, Hall's Market, and the Kingswood Market, continue to serve the community.},

Many Bostonians were unsatisfied with the system, because they could not predict where their children would be enrolled, and because students often had long bus rides to schools that were not necessarily better or more diverse than their other options would have been. However, efforts to change the student assignment policy in 2004 and 2009 failed because participants could not agree on a better system. This impasse ended in 2013, when the Boston School Committee voted to eliminate all school zones and instead use a computer algorithm for student assignment. The algorithm generates a set of choices for each address in the city, which includes the 6 closest schools and then pulls in more distant schools if necessary to ensure that each choice set includes at least 2 schools in the city’s top performance quartile and 2 in the second quartile (Boston Public Schools 2013). This paper is grounded in prior research on the politics of race and urban schooling (Henig et al,. 1999; Author, in press) in mayor-controlled school districts (Henig \& Rich, 2004). We examine why the stalemate over Boston student assignment ended, and why the city adopted this particular, innovative approach to student assignment. Data for the analysis are drawn from interviews with participants, media accounts, and observation of public meetings connected with the process. We conclude that three factors enabled approval of the new policy. First, because the new policy uses a choice algorithm rather than attendance zones, its effects on access to better schools were harder to predict in advance, and less immediately visible. Earlier proposals had redrawn lines on a map, which made it quite visible that students in some neighborhoods would have less access to better-performing schools. Second, many participants believed that promoting diversity in schools (one of the goals of the previous policy) was no longer a relevant goal in a school system whose students are 87\% students of color. Finally, getting students into schools closer to their homes had long been a goal of the city’s popular mayor, who was in his final term. The paper’s main contribution is to analyze how race-blind policies may perpetuate racial inequality; it also illustrates the complexity of racial issues in a mayorally controlled school district.},

  abstract = {Although regional equity scholars have demonstrated how cross-jurisdictional collaboration on transportation, housing, and employment can promote opportunity for low-income families, few have paid serious attention to the potential of regional educational policy to improve opportunity for children. This study seeks to address this gap by examining inter-district “collaboratives” or cooperative agreements between school districts within a metropolitan area. These collaborative arrangements address two inter-related demographic shifts: the rising level of segregation in public schools and the shift from within district segregation to between-district segregation. This article examines three regional collaboratives (Rochester, NY, Omaha, NE, and Minneapolis, MN) that involve varying degrees of cooperation, funding, and legal force. Drawing on 60 in-depth interviews across the three sites, this analysis considers how each program’s design features interact with local political dynamics to shape the degree to which these collaboratives are able to achieve policy goals.},

Their common theme is local government. “The Economics of Zoning Laws” (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985) argued that zoning is the product of rational, if not always admirable, economic calculation by voters in American municipalities. As Dick Babcock, the late dean of practicing land-use lawyers, used to say, nobody loves zoning but the people. “Regulatory Takings” (Harvard University Press, 1995) explored the constitutional ways by which the excesses of zoning might be curbed without infringing excessively on local governance. A special interest during this phase of my career were follow-ups on regulatory takings cases to see what happened afterwards, as in the photographic essays (Lucas Essay) (Lucas Update) on Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992). A rethinking of regulatory takings is in my 2007 investigation of the facts of Miller v. Schoene, the case of the cedar trees that made apples go bad. It has made me less optimistic about the doctrine’s viability.},

Evolving from the initial goal two years ago of providing  Hartford families with up-to-date information on schools through the SmartChoices website, Achieve Hartford!’s Choice Education Program was created to address the reality  that many families cannot access and fully utilize information online without assistance.   Information and training related to school choice needed to be brought out to parents in  their communities, and – using mobile technology and the SmartChoices website as tools – the  Achieve Hartford!’s Choice Education Program has delivered just that, and more.  The purpose of Achieve Hartford!’s Choice Education Program is to help families gain the  knowledge and confidence they need to effectively navigate school choice in Hartford on  behalf of their children.  The intended outcome is not only to help more families make more informed choices, but also to help families in Hartford become familiar with the school  district processes they need to understand in order to have a sustained, positive relationship  with the education system in the long term.   All indicators point to a very successful first year of operation, with outcomes that include: More than 80 visits to community-based pre-school providers and Hartford schools, More than 50 pre-school staff trained, and More than 900 families empowered to make informed decisions on behalf of their  children. This report presents both a detailed explanation – and evaluation – of the 2011 Choice  Education Program administered by Achieve Hartford! on behalf of Hartford parents and  school children.  The report also documents best practices and key factors necessary to  running a successful outreach program of this kind, as well as some systemic challenges present in carrying out this work.},

  abstract = {'Which school should I choose for my child?' For many parents, this question is one of the most important of their lives. 'School choice' is a slogan being voiced around the globe, conjuring images of a marketplace with an abundance of educational options. Those promoting educational choice also promise equality, social advantage, autonomy, and self-expression to families. But what does this globalisation of school choice actually look like on the ground? This collection brings together educationalists, anthropologists, and sociologists who use a rich array of empirical data to understand the complex realities of school choice across a range of political and social settings: in Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, England, India, Israel, Japan, Singapore, Tanzania, and the United States. Together they show that, while the language of school choice has spread globally, it has done so unevenly across and within nations, and is always interpreted through local social and historical contexts. Neo-liberal policy initiatives are re-shaping education systems in many nations, but in complex and varied ways. This collection shows that rather than eliminating equity concerns, they re-embed them within new frameworks of choice and accountability. This is an important book for those interested in comparative education, as well as the sociology and politics of schooling. CONTENTS Acknowledgements Martin Forsey, Scott Davies \& Geoffrey Walford.

This article explores the relationship between charter schools and segregation across the country, in 40 states, the District of Columbia, and several dozen metropolitan areas with large enrollments of charter school students in 2007-08. The descriptive analysis of the charter school enrollment is aimed at understanding the characteristics of students enrolled in charter schools and the extent to which charter school students are segregated, including how charter school segregation compare to students in traditional public schools. This article examines these questions at different levels, aggregating school-level enrollment to explore patterns among metropolitan areas, states, and the nation using three national datasets. Our findings suggest that charters currently isolate students by race and class. This analysis of recent data finds that charter schools are more racially isolated than traditional public schools in virtually every state and large metropolitan area in the nation. In some regions, white students are overrepresented in charter schools while in other charter schools; minority students have little exposure to white students. Data about the extent to which charter schools serve low-income and English Language Learners is incomplete, but suggest that a substantial share of charter schools may not enroll such students. As charters represent an increasing share of our public schools, they influence the level of segregation experienced by all of our nation's school-aged children. After two decades, the promise of charter schools to use choice to foster integration and equality in American education has yet to be realized. (Contains 50 footnotes, 46 tables and 9 figures.)},

  author = {Frankenberg, Erica},
  date = {2015-04-19},
  abstract = {Rationale: Student assignment policies (SAPs) in K-12 schools can either reproduce or help ameliorate existing inequality. Some districts are trying to maintain voluntarily-adopted integration policies despite the Supreme Court’s most recent decision, which prohibited most race-conscious school choice policies that were the effective and popular ways of accomplishing integration. While alternative policies with minimal or no use of race are still permitted, it is unclear whether they will create diverse schools. This research examines the new generation of school choice policies post-Parents Involved to understand how they affect diversity and equity in our multiracial, yet increasingly race-neutral era.  Research questions are: To what extent are schools racially and economically diverse before and after the “new generation” of controlled choice policies?  Are there differences by student characteristics in who gets their school choices under the new SAPs? How does receiving a top school choice predict who enrolls?  I analyze the controlled choice policies of Jefferson County, Kentucky, which considers the racial and socioeconomic characteristics of students’ Census block group instead of individual characteristics in determining students’ assignment.  Theoretical Rationale: SAPs are designed to change the composition of students in schools. SAPs that have voluntary integration have two aims: 1) to reduce racially isolated schools because these schools have fewer educational resources that matter for students’ learning (Linn \& Welner, 2007); and 2) to create diverse schools, which has long-term perpetuating outcomes for students (Pettigrew \& Tropp, 2006; Wells \& Crain, 1994).  School choice is increasingly popular but choice-only policies tend to produce further stratification (APA Brief, 2006; Dougherty, et al., 2013; Hastings, Kane, and Staiger, 2010; Orfield, 2013), but choice policies can be designed in ways that further integration (see Author, 2013; Betts, et al., 2006). Options remain for districts to pursue voluntary integration through a “new generation” of controlled choice policies that do not use an individual’s racial identity for school assignment (Author, 2011; Reardon, Yun, \& Kurlaender, 2006). Though SES plans or geography-based plans may create more diverse schools than policies not considering either set of characteristics, they are not as successful at producing racial integration as individual race-based plans (Reardon et al., 2006; Reardon \& Rhodes, 2011; Richards, et al., 2012).  Methods: I employ quantitative methods to analyze data from Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) from 2006-07 to present. I use data from the NCES Common Core of Data to calculate school-level racial segregation using several measures: concentration, exposure and information theory index. Additionally, I analyze de-identified student level data from JCPS students’ applications and subsequent enrollment. I estimate logistic regression models before and after the policy change predicting whether students were granted their first choice or not and to examine whether individual characteristics or receipt of first choice school make students likelier to enroll.  Significance: This analysis provides useful evidence about the efficacy of new types of choice policies that aim to create diverse, equitable schools under new legal constraints. It also enhances our understanding of the evolving relationships among race, SES, and educational inequality.},

Fuller has always believed that it is important for poor and working class Black people to gain access to the levers of power dictating their lives. He believes that those of us who are educated and resourceful have a moral and historical responsibility to help them, and that is what he has always tried to do. Early in his life he found truth in the words of the great Frederick Douglass: 'Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did, and it never will.' \textasciitilde{} 'So struggle we must' says Fuller. That understanding of the relationship between struggle and progress is what propelled him down dark alleys and dirt roads in some of North Carolinas poorest communities in the 1960s and pushed him into the bush, mountains, and war-torn villages of Africa nearly a decade later. \textasciitilde{} 'It is what pushes me still in the fight over one of the most contentious education issues of this era: parental choice. I believe deep in my heart that giving low-income and working class parents the power (and the money) to make choices about the schools their children attend will not only revolutionize education but provide the compass to a better life for the many poor, Black children stuck in failing systems. ... Education reform is one of the most crucial social justice issues of our time, and I will spend the rest of my days fighting for my people, most especially those without the power or the resources to fight for themselves.'},

  abstract = {Over the last three decades, Connecticut has shifted from being one of the most egalitarian states to having one of the biggest income gaps between rich and poor households, as indicated in this report by the Connecticut Association for Human Services and Connecticut Voices for Children. Over this period, Connecticut experienced the greatest increase in income inequality among all states between its high and low-income households.  In 1977-79, the gap between the richest fifth and the middle fifth of families in Connecticut was relatively low, ranking 42nd among all states, but the state ranked 7th highest in inequality by 2005-07.  Similarly, the gap between the richest and poorest fifth of households is now the 3rd worst in the country, up from 46th. The greatest share of income gains have gone to the wealthiest 1 percent, who have vastly outpaced even the very well-off. The share of total state Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) going to the top 1 percent has soared over the last two decades, increasing from 17\% to 28\%. The 99th percentile of taxpayers in Connecticut earn about \$766,000 in state AGI, over \$500,000 more than the \$225,000 earned by well-off households at the 95th percentile. The income of the near-rich is actually closer to that of the poorest fifth of households, who earn \$17,000, than it is to the \$766,000 earned by the wealthiest Connecticut residents. Connecticut’s inequality ranks second only to New York’s among U.S. states on the Gini coefficient, one of the most widely used measures of inequality.},

  abstract = {The 1890s saw the rise of segregated planned suburbs in the United States. A wide cross-section of the British public made those suburbs possible. Building Suburban Power is the first site to map the connections between British investment, large and small, and segregated suburban development. It is part of a larger book project of the same name. Following the money that financed segregated suburbs links those suburbs to people, processes, and places across time and space. Suburbs may seem uniquely American, yet Caribbean slavery, British industrialization, imperialism, and even the battles for women’s rights all directly affected who invested in them and where the capital came from. As the maps show below, Egypt, India, Antigua, the Congo served as some of the other sources of wealth for those who financed America’s segregated suburbs. Just as scholars are now working to understand the impact of slavery long after emancipation throughout the Atlantic world, so too must the history of American housing—of the very streets, trees, buildings, and pipes—be placed in a long global view. Doing so does not elide the local specificity of housing development, nor does it erase the grassroots movements that fought the white supremacy at its core. Rather, determining who bankrolled the start of modern American housing segregation sharpens our understanding of why exclusion assumed particular forms and allowed people—such as developers and certain homeowners—to stake new claims to power. British investment initiated a wave of experimentation with the profitability of racial segregation in real estate that ultimately became codified into federal housing policy. The rise of suburban housing segregation not only coincided with the rise of Jim Crow; it formed one of Jim Crow’s strongest foundations. The legacy endures today.},

Prior to the advent of oft-studied federal agencies during the Great Depression, developers shared ideas—first through informal correspondence in the 1890s and, later, through the National Association of Real Estate Boards (NAREB). Among the most frequently discussed subjects was the exclusion of undesirable residents from planned communities. Using the case study of a Baltimore company, this article explores how ideas about residential segregation circulated into federal policy as well as their enduring legacy. After the local experiments of the 1890s, developers often spearheaded a growing movement to professionalize real estate. As NAREB leaders, they tied a vision of discrimination to the institution’s ethical and scientific aspirations. Once the association gained legitimacy and cultural capital, it supplied the government with the ideas that became standards and the personnel who codified them.},

  abstract = {The story of the rise of the segregated suburb often begins during the New Deal and the Second World War, when sweeping federal policies hollowed out cities, pushed rapid suburbanization, and created a white homeowner class intent on defending racial barriers. Paige Glotzer offers a new understanding of the deeper roots of suburban segregation. The mid-twentieth-century policies that favored exclusionary housing were not simply the inevitable result of popular and elite prejudice, she reveals, but the culmination of a long-term effort by developers to use racism to structure suburban real estate markets. Glotzer charts how the real estate industry shaped residential segregation, from the emergence of large-scale suburban development in the 1890s to the postwar housing boom. Focusing on the Roland Park Company as it developed Baltimore’s wealthiest, whitest neighborhoods, she follows the money that financed early segregated suburbs, including the role of transnational capital, mostly British, in the U.S. housing market. She also scrutinizes the business practices of real estate developers, from vetting homebuyers to negotiating with municipal governments for services. She examines how they sold the idea of the suburbs to consumers and analyzes their influence in shaping local and federal housing policies. Glotzer then details how Baltimore’s experience informed the creation of a national real estate industry with professional organizations that lobbied for planned segregated suburbs. How the Suburbs Were Segregated sheds new light on the power of real estate developers in shaping the origins and mechanisms of a housing market in which racial exclusion and profit are still inextricably intertwined.},

  abstract = {Over the last two decades, state and federal laws and grant programs, such as state accountability polices, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), Race to the Top, Title I School Improvement Grants, and State Longitudinal Data System Grants, have given state education agencies (SEAs) considerably more responsibilities for directing and guiding the improvement of low-performing schools. At the same time, they have pressed SEAs and school districts to incorporate research-based school improvement policies and practices in their statewide systems of support for low-performing schools, technical assistance for districts, professional development for teachers, and school improvement programs. Policymakers have urged SEAs to engage with organizations external to their own agencies to extend their strained capacity, and to help them collect and use research or other evidence. A variety of organizations involved in this enterprise have emerged over the last two decades. For example, the 2002 authorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act’s (ESEA) comprehensive assistance centers was specifically designed to provide and encourage SEA’s use of research. Although studies of districts’ and schools’ use of research exist, we know little about how SEAs search for, select, and use research and other kinds of evidence in their school improvement strategies. While one might assume similarities in research use behaviors, both the organizational structures of SEAs and the population of external organizations with which they interact are quite different than schools and districts, and the most recent in-depth study of SEAs was conducted nearly 20 years ago. The exploratory study on which this brief is based was designed to fill that gap by examining: 1) where SEA staff search for research, evidence-based, and practitioner knowledge related to school improvement; 2) whether and how SEA staff use research and these other types of knowledge to design, implement, and refine state school improvement policies, programs and practices; and, 3) how SEAs are organized to manage and use such knowledge.},

The following four magnet schools are in Bridgeport: (1) Central High School-Magnet Component; (2) High Horizons Magnet School; (3) Multicultural Magnet School; and (4) Park City Magnet School. The following two magnet schools are in Hartford: (1) the Classical Magnet School of Greater Hartford; and (2) the Greater Hartford Academy of the Performing Arts. The following two magnet schools are in Stamford: (1) Hart School; and (2) Westover Elementary Magnet School. In Stratford there is one magnet school--Stratford Academy. And finally, Norwalk has one magnet school--Columbus School. A concluding directory provides the following information on each of the schools: (1) address; (2) phone number; (3) principal; (4) grade levels; (5) number of students; (6) student selection process; and (7) magnet (i.e., the special focus of the school).

Important as that decision is, however, it ignores the elephant in the room. The real problem is the 400-year-old system of towns based on the parish boundaries of the Puritans, who required that everyone be able to walk to church. That's why Connecticut towns are approximately the same size geographically — although some of what we quaintly call cities are among the smallest towns (17 square miles in the case of Hartford, 5.5 square miles in New London)."},

These public schools offer an alternative to mandatory assignment of students to schools and to busing to bring about racial balance and, as a form of public school choice, are congruent with bottom-up reform. Research results concerning the effectiveness of magnet schools are mixed. Currently, many large urban school districts are at the crossroads of sweeping changes in the use of magnet schools as a means to racial desegregation, with a series of major federal court rulings repudiating district attempts to maintain race-conscious admission policies to promote racial diversity in these schools.},

We examine differences in background, including race, educational attainment and socioeconomic status, as well as differences in parent satisfaction with their child’s previous school, parent involvement in school, parents’ priorities in school choice, as well as parents’ social networks. After controlling for background characteristics, we find that parent satisfaction with their child’s previous school was not a predictor of considering a private school. Rather, parent involvement seems to be a more important indicator of whether or not a parent would consider sending their child to a private school. In this case, parents are not ‘pushed’ away from public schools, contrary to much public rhetoric that suggests private schools are somehow inherently ‘better’ than public schools and parents who are dissatisfied with their public schools will opt for private schools. Instead, these findings suggest a ‘pull’ towards private schools. Parents may perceive that parent involvement and parent communication are more easily facilitated and valued in private schools.},

  abstract = {In 1945, six African American families from St. Louis, Detroit, and Washington, D.C., began a desperate fight to keep their homes. Each of them had purchased a property that prohibited the occupancy of African Americans and other minority groups through the use of legal instruments called racial restrictive covenants--one of the most pervasive tools of residential segregation in the aftermath of World War II. Over the next three years, local activists and lawyers at the NAACP fought through the nation's courts to end the enforcement of these discriminatory contracts. Unjust Deeds explores the origins and complex legacies of their dramatic campaign, culminating in a landmark Supreme Court victory in Shelley v. Kraemer (1948). Restoring this story to its proper place in the history of the black freedom struggle, Jeffrey D. Gonda's groundbreaking study provides a critical vantage point to the simultaneously personal, local, and national dimensions of legal activism in the twentieth century and offers a new understanding of the evolving legal fight against Jim Crow in neighborhoods and courtrooms across America. -- Book jacket.},

  abstract = {purchased on Google books The 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, ignited nationwide protests and brought widespread attention police brutality and institutional racism. But Ferguson was no aberration. As Colin Gordon shows in this urgent and timely book, the events in Ferguson exposed not only the deep racism of the local police department but also the ways in which decades of public policy effectively segregated people and curtailed citizenship not just in Ferguson but across the St. Louis suburbs.  Citizen Brown uncovers half a century of private practices and public policies that resulted in bitter inequality and sustained segregation in Ferguson and beyond. Gordon shows how municipal and school district boundaries were pointedly drawn to contain or exclude African Americans and how local policies and services--especially policing, education, and urban renewal--were weaponized to maintain civic separation. He also makes it clear that the outcry that arose in Ferguson was no impulsive outburst but rather an explosion of pent-up rage against long-standing systems of segregation and inequality--of which a police force that viewed citizens not as subjects to serve and protect but as sources of revenue was only the most immediate example. Worse, Citizen Brown illustrates the fact that though the greater St. Louis area provides some extraordinarily clear examples of fraught racial dynamics, in this it is hardly alone among American cities and regions.  Interactive maps and other companion resources to Citizen Brown are available at the book website.},

However, when white households with children do move, they are not more likely than white households without children to move to neighborhoods with fewer blacks or less diversity. Young children may matter for segregation because they influence families to leave more diverse neighborhoods, and white movers generally move into neighborhoods with less diversity, whether or not they have children.},

The program focuses on the development of legal efforts to reduce racial isolation in Connecticut's public schools and it reveals the change in perspective that has occurred [sic] among some desegregation proponents who now advocate a 'go-slow' approach if mass busing is involved in reducing racial isolation in public schools."--1979 Peabody Awards entry form. This program examines what changes have occurred since Connecticut's schools first began to be integrated in the late 1960's and the effects integration has had on the quality of education received by Connecticut's students. The case of Brown vs. the Board of Education is discussed along with the problems school boards are facing in interpreting the Court's ruling in the case. Several local school systems are looked at to see how integration has affected them and whether integration has succeeded or not. Busing for desegregation and alternatives to busing are also discussed, including a discussion on merging urban and suburban school systems to achieve a more equally balanced racial mix. Includes excerpts from a speech by William Horowitz, former chairman of the Connecticut Board of Education.

  abstract = {As many commentators have pointed out, the land use patterns prevalent in the United States since the advent of Euclidean-style zoning have played a direct role in the development of a surprisingly broad range of problems: “[b]y fostering or requiring low density development with a high separation of uses, Euclidean zoning is one of the great generators of suburban sprawl, with all of its environmental, economic, and social costs.” These costs include pollution, loss of wilderness and farmland, racial and socioeconomic segregation of the population, and legal obstacles to effective urban rehabilitation.6 Moreover, in combination with prevailing patterns of local funding, the socioeconomic segregation caused by Euclidean zoning perpetuates itself by channeling less well-off children into chronically underequipped public schools and stretching the resources of many urban municipalities too thin, leaving them to choose between raising property tax rates or allowing their infrastructure to decay. That devil’s bargain bolsters the tendency of middle- and higher-income people to live in suburbs rather than cities, deepening the downward spiral in which many American cities find themselves. And the damage goes even further: “many current zoning practices disregard or even work against crime prevention goals” in both cities and suburbs. This is particularly problematic in light of the fact that “Euclidean systems of separation—conventional zoning—have been implemented ubiquitously” in the United States: “[a]bout ninety-seven percent of incorporated communities zone.”},

  abstract = {"It is well recognized that despite its wealthy towns and major corporations, Connecticut, like  many states, has faced difficult economic times during the Great Recession. The official  poverty rate of 10 percent reflects only part of the story of financial instability in the state. The  official U.S. poverty rate, which was developed in 1965, has not been updated since 1974,  and is not adjusted to reflect cost of living differences across the U.S. A lack of accurate  measurements and even language to frame a discussion has made it difficult for states –  including Connecticut – to identify the full extent of the economic challenges that so many of  their residents face. This Report presents four groundbreaking instruments that measure the size and condition of  households struggling financially, and it introduces the term ALICE – Asset Limited, Income  Constrained, Employed. The Report includes findings on households that earn below the  ALICE Threshold, a level based on the actual cost of basic household necessities in each  county in Connecticut. It outlines the role of ALICE households in the state economy, the  public resources spent on households in crisis, and the implications of struggling households  for the wider community. Using the realistic measures of the financial survival threshold for each county in Connecticut,  the Report reveals a far larger problem than previously identified. Connecticut has 141,628  households with income below the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) but also has 332,817 ALICE  households, which have income above the FPL but below the ALICE Threshold. These  numbers are eye-opening: in total, 474,445 households in Connecticut – fully 35 percent  – are struggling to support themselves."},

  abstract = {This paper examines the implementation of school desegregation reform and policy efforts in the greater Hartford region of Connecticut, with a focus on the years 2008-2015. ~These efforts have been the result of the 1996 Connecticut Supreme Court decision in Sheff v. O’Neill, which mandated Connecticut to desegregate the racially isolated schools in Hartford, its capital.  Today, the two main components of compliance with Sheff v. O’Neill are: (1) an interdistrict magnet school system, and (2) a voluntary two-way busing program called Open Choice. ~These programs, operated by the Capital Region Education Council (CREC), have achieved substantial progress toward their goal of school integration in the Hartford region, but many Hartford students remain underserved in racially isolated schools.  This paper explores and analyzes these Sheff-related efforts using an educational change framework; they are now in the continuation phase, but their future remains unclear.  The Hartford school system and interdistrict reforms face numerous challenges ahead, but their successes and failures should be learned from.  Despite desegregation being court mandated, Hartford is a model for integration reforms and interdistrict cooperation, and this paper seeks to shed light on the successful aspects of these efforts and challenges for the future.},

The Sheff movement has not been forgotten, but to a certain extent misunderstood and bypassed.  Similar to Brown v. Board of Education, the legacy of Sheff is troubled—causing numerous stakeholders to question whether benefits have outweighed the costs, particularly for students of color.  The Sheff case and its outcomes are explored to the present day, discussing future implications for students of color, a strategy of regionalism, and considerations of where the movement and public education in the region goes from here.},

  abstract = {In debates about accountability, advocates often point to individual “high‐flying” schools that achieve high test scores despite serving disadvantaged populations. Using a near‐census of U.S. public schools, this new analysis considers the likelihood that schools become high flyers. The results suggest that of the more than 60,000 schools considered, low‐poverty schools are 22 times more likely to reach consistently high academic achievement compared with high‐poverty schools. Schools serving student populations that are both low poverty and low minority are 89 times more likely to be consistently high performing compared with high‐poverty, high‐minority schools. This does not mean that schools have no influence over student achievement, or that schools should be unaccountable, but that accountability systems need to have carefully defined objectives and measures of school progress. In addition, the results suggest the continued need to address home and community factors in the pursuit of educational equity.},

  abstract = {The videos in this collection are from the personal collection of Charles “Butch” Lewis (1944-2015), co-founder of the Hartford chapter of the Black Panther Party. Lewis believed it was imperative that his collection be made accessible to the public, and ensured that commitment through his donation of the videos to the Hartford Public Library. This collection includes African American, West Indian American, Puerto Rican, and white American voices from the North End, South End, and Downtown communities of Hartford in 1969, providing rich information about a moment immediately following three consecutive summers of riots in Hartford. Discussion topics include Hartford’s riot of 1969, housing, employment, education, police community relations, politics, and urban renewal projects. The videos were produced by a team of Canadian filmmakers, including director Julian Biggs and cameraman, Baylis Glascock, a UCLA student originally from Missouri. They were commissioned by the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) to conduct a social documentary process called the Fogo method in Hartford in 1969. The method was developed as part of the Canadian National Film Board’s ‘Challenge for Change’ initiative, which began in 1966. Named after the first place in which it was conducted, Fogo Island in Newfoundland, the method entails that the filmmakers film and interview various individuals and groups of a place that is experiencing issues around communication. The footage is then shown to people who would not normally be in the same room together and their reactions would be filmed. They would then find a way to come together to have a conversation and ideally create an action plan to deal with issues that arose. This process was not completed in Hartford, as Biggs, the director of the project, fell victim to a terminal illness. Although the project was passed on to an advisor, Verna Fields, there was a change in administration, with Richard Nixon becoming president and Donald Rumsfeld becoming the head of OEO. Rumsfeld suspended all in-progress Fogo method projects.},

One, Spoll said, was housing discrimination, either enforced informally or through the enactment of ordinances. In West Hartford, where Spoll began building houses in the mid-1950s, "neighborhoods were tacitly redistricted. There was a limit placed on who can buy in certain distinct neighborhoods," Spoll said. Spoll, who is Jewish, said such discrimination not only applied to Jewish families, but was "a Catholic and Protestant thing as well." And segregation applied to a growing minority population. Around the state, many towns adopted large-lot zoning ordinances as a way to discriminate against ethnic groups, Fusari and Hanbury said. But the practice also served to drive up prices. Fusari said zoning requirements of an acre or more were inefficient because the towns were forced to pay for roads and sewers that served few people. But such zoning also pushed up the cost of housing for everyone by creating a scarcity of land."},

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Efforts to account for the history of public housing in America are fraught with competing narratives. Many scholars, policy analysts, architects, and planners seek explanations for the successes and failures of housing projects from within the program itself. Some argue that projects rise and fall based on the management performance of housing authorities, while others look to racism, concentrated poverty, crime, and other social conditions. For many, the challenges faced by public housing result from the alienating and dehumanizing qualities of modernist architecture. Still, others argue that the Housing Act of 1937 was compromised from the beginning and, thus, produced compromised results. This article acknowledges all of these factors as important yet insufficient to account for overall public housing performance; it reframes the narrative of public housing within broader urban conditions, suggesting that the fate of public housing is intimately tied to the fate of the cities that surround them. Takeaway for practice: Current accounts of the fate of public housing tend to reflect narrow managerial, planning, and architectural concerns. As a result, the literature on public housing insufficiently informs long-term policy decisions and planning practices. Solutions will only emerge when policymakers and planners take into account the impact of capital flight, social disinvestment, and the weak powers of cities to overcome such obstacles. After all, these urban conditions apply as much to recently created HOPE VI neighborhoods as to the high-rise public housing neighborhoods they replaced. Research support: None.},

Although studies of school reform increasingly recognize that politics is inevitably intertwined with reform efforts, the conceptualization of politics is thin and largely divorced from the broader literature in the discipline of political science.

Research Design: This is a review and analytical synthesis of literature that for the most part has not looked at the education policy arena in order to derive insights relevant to contemporary efforts to infuse education policy with greater attention to data. Conclusions/Recommendations: Rather than block the door to politics, those who hope to promote informed policy making might consider ways to use politics to protect and defend high-quality data and their informed application.},

  publisher = {{Harvard University Press}},
  abstract = {Book Description: In this genial and challenging overview of endless debates over school reform, Rick Hess shows that even bitter opponents in debates about how to improve schools agree on much more than they realize—and that much of it must change radically. Cutting through the tangled thickets of right- and left-wing dogma, he clears the ground for transformation of the American school system.  Whatever they think of school vouchers or charter schools, teacher merit pay or bilingual education, most educators and advocates take many other things for granted. The one-teacher–one-classroom model. The professional full-time teacher. Students grouped in age-defined grades. The nine-month calendar. Top-down local district control. All were innovative and exciting—in the nineteenth century. As Hess shows, the system hasn’t changed since most Americans lived on farms and in villages, since school taught you to read, write, and do arithmetic, and since only an elite went to high school, let alone college. Arguing that a fundamentally nineteenth century system can’t be right for a twenty-first century world, Hess suggests that uniformity gets in the way of quality, and urges us to create a much wider variety of schools, to meet a greater range of needs for different kinds of talents, needed by a vastly more complex and demanding society.

But navigating school zones has become much trickier in the past few years as more families with young children put down roots in the city. Even living two blocks from a well-regarded public school no longer means your child will get in, and with many neighborhoods becoming increasingly expensive, it isn’t always possible to squeeze into a smaller apartment.},

  abstract = {Higham's work stands as the seminal work in the history of American nativism. The work is a careful, well-documented study of nationalism and ethnic prejudice, and chronicles the power and violence of these two ideas in American society from 1860 to 1925. He significantly moves beyond previous treatments of nativism, both in chronology and in interpretive sophistication. Higham defines nativism as a defensive type of nationalism or an intense opposition to an internal minority on the grounds of the group's foreign connections. By defining nativism as a set of attitudes or a state of mind, he sets the course for his book as tracing "trace an emotionally charged impulse" rather than "an actual social process or condition." As he argues that the ideological content of nativism remained consistent, he uses emotional intensity as a measure to trace in detail public opinion from the relative calm following the Civil War to the Johnson-Reed act of 1924 that severely limited European immigration.  Strangers in the Land is, then, a history of public opinion, whose purpose is to show how nativism evolved in society and in action. Higham seeks to explain what could inflame xenophobia and who resisted it. He saw his work as part of a renewed interest in the study of nationalism following the national upheavals in the wake of the McCarthy hearings. Surely Higham's mentor at the University of Wisconsin, intellectual historian Merle Curti, influenced Higham's approach in seeking to examine the power of nationalism as an idea. Also influential was the intellectual climate of the 1950s with its of distrust of ideology and distain of prejudice. Higham admits being repelled by the nationalist delusions of the Cold War, again helping to explain why his study concentrates on seeking some explanation for the irrational and violent outbreaks. The book thus focuses on points of conflict, "antagonisms that belong within ideologies of passionate national consciousness." For example, Higham's explains the 100 percent American movement in terms of progressive ideals and the desire of Americans to shape immigrants into a particular ideal of "Americanness" through education and assimilation. This intellectual construct eventually gave way to the racial thinking to which Higham assigns much influence in the efforts to restrict immigration. Ideology is also central to his chapter on the history of the idea of racism in which he argues that Anglo-Saxon nationalism, literary naturalism and a nascent understanding of genetics combined to bring forth arguments for immigration restriction to preserve the racial purity of the American people. Thus, key for Higham's argument is the power of ideas in shaping individual behavior and thereby shaping history.  This text is an absolute must-read for anyone seeking to understand American nativism and the darker side of nationalism.},

The case of Flint, Michigan, complicates these views, at once illustrating the depth of governmental commitment to segregation in a northern community and showing how segregated schools and neighborhoods helped construct one another. The Flint case also reveals new modes of segregationist thought. Throughout much of the twentieth century, Flint’s city leaders thought of segregation as splitting, and they sought to divide their city along racial lines. But they thought of segregation as joining as well. Drawing on various strands of progressive reform and educational thought, Flint’s educational, business, and philanthropic leaders believed community bonds would be stronger in segregated neighborhoods anchored by their schools. Flint’s “community schools” program worked toward this end, exemplifying the paired embrace of segregation as joining and splitting, and becoming a model for educators in hundreds of cities nationwide.},

The model explained an estimated 59 percent of the variance in HOLC grade." See author's forthcoming JUH article." to test whether HOLC maps influenced private lenders (the basis for Jackson's original charge), author analyzed sample of mortgage transactions involving private lenders in Philly from 1937 to 1950 to measure effect of HOLC grade on lending patterns (percentage and whether or not worse terms) source: Philadlephia Realty Directory and Service, annual listing of mortgage transactions findings: "neigther the security grade nor the property's proximity to a red area explain differences in the total number of loans it received or in the loan-to-value ratio. Mortgates made in areas with worse grades and closer to red areas did have slightly higher interest rates. Rhese higher interest rates probably reflected widespread knowledge of where racial minorities lived rather than access and adherence to the Home Owners' Loan Coprporation grading scheme." p87 "urban researchers have overstated the significance of the security maps on lending, particularly by arguing that private lenders categorically refused to make loans in areas colored red. The areas considered most ahazardous by the agendcy probably did suffer from disinvestment over the next several decades, as Jackson noted. But disinvestment happened independently of the HOLC's security maps. Rather than causing redlining, the maps refvlected the conditions in Philadelphia's neighborhoods in the 1930s as well as the dominant attitudes and methods of the real estate and appraisal industries." 88 "Redlining during the middle decades of the twentieth century was a more complicated process than many historians have appreciated...." in addition to HOLC, FHA also made maps starting in 1934 showing racial composition and housing conditions in several cities, and it encouraged private lenders to follows its standards; some private lenders (such as Metro Life Insurance Company) also created their own maps categoriezing neighborhoods by race, ethnicity, and class, and they" assumed a racial and ecological conception of neighborhood change" p90},

Address-level mortgage data from Philadelphia from the 1940s are analyzed using spatial regression, "hot spot" analysis, and surface interpolation. Employing multiple definitions of redlining that focus on process and outcome, as well as spatial and statistical relationships in lending, the analyses result in a series of map layers that indicate where redlining may have occurred. In addition to providing some evidence of lending discrimination, this article promotes an explicitly spatial view of redlining that has conceptual and methodological implications for research on contemporary and historical redlining.},

And both business and neighborhood interests ultimately sought political and governmental solutions to their problems. The result was an era of ghetto maintenance and expansion that was designed, in large part, to meet the needs of the contending white factions. Out of the chaos emerged the second ghetto, an entity now distinguished by government support and sanction" pxiii about "ethnics": To say that some fought racial succession and valued stable, centrally located urban neighborhood is nto to claim that all did. Although the numbers are impossible to determine, it seems certain that hte vast majority of the descendants of both the 'old' and 'new' immigrations became assimilated and mobile, joined the post-World War II trek to the suburbs, and never bothered to look back..... [but] if the inner-city "ethnics" who were concerned about communal stability and neighborhood solidarity were staistically insignificant compared with their more assimilated counterparts (and this is only a supposition), their impact on postwar public policy in Chicago was considerable." pxiii Ch1 The second ghetto and the dynamics of neighborhood change contrast between interracial violence of 1919 "communal" riot with white mobs attacking black ghettos vs property damage of 1968 "commodity" riot after King's assassination path was not ineviatable, but determined by degree of governmental intervention, but expansion of second ghetto was sanctioned and supported by govt - siting of public housing projects  - HOLC and FHA indirectly furthered seg by support white mid-class sub flight late 1930s Ida B Wells homes supported by black press, despite segregation, due to dire need for decent housing; with many black trade workers, yet by 1943 black Chicagoans protested National Housing Agency dference to local restrictive covenants push-pull factors of second migration, leading to severe housing shortage amid rise of WWII defense industry diverted away from construction "the coincidence of plentiful jobs and scarce housing" p20 crisis grew worse after WWII; dilapidated construction 1950s suburban exodus reshaped central city "As the more well-to-do whites were selectively drained from Chicago's core, vacancies began to appear around the Black Belt.

Some of the more proper firms refused to sell property to blacks until 50\% or more of the area had 'gone'. ... Once the 'disreputable' dealer had done his job, the more 'respectable' flocked to do business in transition neighborhoods where their own particular 'black threshold' had been inevitably met'." p34-35 working and lower-middle-class whites "caught in this economic squeeze" with "nowhere to go"...

The imputation of brotherhood with the ethnic, working-class rock throwers would have been more than they could bear. Yet, there was just such a consensus. Each of the various white groups or interests agreed on the fundamental undesirability of racial succession.

This regional focus offers insight into the patterns of interdistrict choice and the influence these patterns have on equity within a metropolitan region. Findings from this study indicate that relatively higher income students were more likely to take advantage of interdistrict choice, and that choice was more often used by students to exit from a less advantaged context (as measured by socioeconomic status) to a relatively more advantaged one. The article concludes with recommendations for policymakers in designing more equity-minded choice policies."},

  abstract = {Background/Context: Over the past several decades, the structure of school segregation has changed significantly. In the past, students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds tended to be separated into different buildings within school districts; increasingly, however, students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds are likely to be separated into entirely separate districts (Clotfelter, 2004). This growing problem of between-district segregation poses a unique set of challenges for districts and policymakers seeking to advance integration, as districts have administrative authority only over policies that cover their own boundaries. The changing configuration of school segregation, therefore, requires a better understanding of, and more creative solutions aimed at, this policy problem. Focus of Study: This article explores the dilemmas created by between-district segregation and school district fragmentation in terms of efforts to diversify schools. In our analysis, we examine four predominant approaches that have been used in city governance reform to address the problems of municipal fragmentation: annexation, consolidation, mobility programs, and metropolitan governance reform. Within each section, we examine the potential of each of these approaches as a solution to the problems associated with school district fragmentation. Data Collection and Analysis: We first review existing research to examine what is known empirically about between-district segregation, and the role of school district fragmentation as a contributing factor. We then review literature about policy efforts to address problems caused by fragmentation in noneducational domains. Conclusions: Each of the policy efforts discussed in this article offer insights as to potential policy directions to improve integration and address the costs of fragmentation. We conclude by considering the types of structures that could serve as potential vehicles for school districts to address the problems of fragmentation, and by discussing how regional cooperation between school districts can incentivized.},

Finnigan seek to build a bridge between two largely disparate, yet interconnected, conversations—those among education reformers on the one hand, and urban reformers on the other. In this carefully considered volume, the authors show how the challenges faced by urban schools are linked to issues of regional equity and civic capacity. More Drawing on examples from a range of cities, including St. Louis, Milwaukee, Palo Alto, Rochester, Omaha, and Minneapolis, Holme and Finnigan trace the policy decisions that have fostered competition for scarce resources between cities and suburbs as well as patterns of segregation by race and income. They highlight the limited ability of technical education reforms and interdistrict desegregation programs to counter the resulting educational inequities. The authors then examine existing regional governance initiatives aimed at promoting equity and reducing inefficiency through city/suburban cooperation. Finally, Holme and Finnigan outline a framework for cross-sector, regional governance mechanisms that would incorporate tax-base sharing, targeted investments in high-poverty communities, and mobility policies to help students and families access better opportunities. The book concludes with a discussion of the political opportunities and challenges presented by such a strategy.},

In this analysis, we examine how several of these subsidized housing programs, public housing and Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) financed housing, relate to patterns of school segregation for children. We use GIS to examine the location of subsidized housing vis-à-vis district boundaries and school attendance boundaries in four Texas counties. We then examine patterns of segregation between schools with and without subsidized housing in their attendance zones, as well as the extent of economic and racial isolation experienced by students in those schools. Our results illustrate that public housing and LIHTC housing developments are zoned to racially and economically isolated schools, and that developments are associated with especially high levels of economic and racial isolation for Black and Latinx students. We conclude by discussing implications for housing and education policy to ameliorate these patterns.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Suburban school districts have undergone significant demographic shifts over the past several decades. The research literature to date, however, has yet to explore how suburban district leaders are responding to such changes, or examine the factors that shape response. In this article, we apply a “zone of mediation” framework to examine how the leaders of one large and rapidly changing suburban school district in Texas responded to its changing student population. In our analysis, we consider the technical, normative, and political dimensions of this district’s response to demographic shifts. Research Methods/Approach: We conducted an in-depth qualitative case study of a large and rapidly changing district in the San Antonio Metropolitan area, which we named “Southern Independent School District.” Our data included interviews with 28 district-level and community actors and interviews with 26 educators across three “focus” schools that were undergoing particularly rapid demographic shifts. Findings and Implications: We found that Southern Independent School District’s response to demographic change focused intensely on technical changes in curriculum and instruction. Such technical changes we found were explicitly adopted to address the needs of the increasing proportion of low-income students and students of color within the district. At the same time, we illustrate how the district failed to address the more challenging normative and political dynamics within the district. This failure, we show, placed significant limits upon the technical reforms that were adopted.},

Hornstein. \_A Nation of Realtors. A Cultural History of the Twentieth-Century American Middle Class\_. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2005. xi + 252 pp. Illustrations, notes, bibliography, index. \$79.95 (cloth), ISBN 0-8223-3528-x; \$22.95 (paper), ISBN 0-8223-3540-9. Extraordinary Agents: The Rise of the Realtor By 1920 the United States was an urban nation and home ownership was becoming a national goal. The marketing and sale of urban real estate was gaining new prominence and meaning. Real estate agents, who in 1908 had formed their first nation-wide organization, and who in 1916 had branded themselves as "realtors," stepped onto the national stage. Recognizing this, in 1922 Sinclair Lewis made Babbitt into the icon of an era. \_Nation of Realtors\_ tells the story of the modern realtor: of his early struggles for identity and respectability (chapters 1-4), of his inter-war influence in Washington, D.C. (chapter 5), and of how from the 1940s he made room for female colleagues (chapters 6, 7). It traces the rise of a business professional and, in a conclusion, the author claims his story also says something about the twentieth-century middle class: about its amorphous identity, its claims to objective knowledge, and about its gendering. These claims are to varying degrees plausible, but the core of the book is a descriptive account of a specific group. It is the plausibility and originality of this account that most readers will care about. Land agents were an important part of the American scene from the very earliest years of European settlement. Since the value of land was variable, and so difficult to estimate or predict, opportunism and speculation were rife. Dealers in real estate were better known for their cunning than their probity. By the 1870s and 1880s, agents in the larger cities were forming local groups that enshrined codes of conduct. In 1908 these groups came together to establish what shortly became the National Association of Real Estate Boards (NAREB). The association struggled for legitimacy and status. At its national convention in 1916 it seized upon the suggestion of Charles N. Chadbourn, an agent from Minneapolis, by adopting "realtor" as the legally-enforceable brand-name for its members. Thus did NAREB membership distinguish "realtors" from "agents." (Lewis was accurate in his use of this term since he made Babbitt a member of the national association.) The benefits of membership were underscored by development of exclusive multiple listing systems, which were an important step towards the creation of what we now recognize as local housing markets. Concerned that the expertise of its members should be systematized and recognized, in the early 1920s NAREB helped fund Richard T. Ely's Institute for Research in Land Economics, which produced both research and educational textbooks. Informing all of this activity was the notion that real estate, and above all the home, constituted the realtor's jurisdiction, or field of expertise. In the 1920s, when the social virtues of home ownership were increasingly emphasized, realtors hitched their wagon to the cause. They were influential in, and gained stature from, Hoover's Better-Homes-in-America campaign. Then, during the Depression, their ideas about mortgage appraisal and underwriting were enshrined in the guidelines of the new Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Indeed, the FHA was prominently staffed by people such as Ernest Fisher and Frederick Babcock who had previously been active in NAREB. As Hornstein points out, the influence went both ways. Federal policies encouraged agents to become realtors, or at least to adopt the practices that realtors pioneered. Within a generation, real estate agents had made huge strides in gaining legitimacy and influence. The remaining part of the story that Hornstein tells is of the social transformation that occurred within this group, notably after 1940. Until then, women were marginal. Meetings reinforced male camaraderie with cigars and robust humor. As late as 1940, less than ten percent of the agents enumerated in the census were women, and the proportion among realtors was lower. Many local boards still did not allow women as members. (Chicago, for example, changed its policy only in 1950.) But in this field, as in so many others, war brought change, especially on the west coast. And when the war ended, Rosie the Riveter became Rosie the Realtor. By 1960 a quarter of all real estate agents were women, largely concentrated in the residential sector. The postwar feminization of real estate may have lagged that of clerical work, but it preceded that of most fields of business and professional endeavor. As Hornstein describes it, the emergence and transformation of the realtors was associated with struggles and tensions but had an inevitable logic. Struggles arose between three conflicting demands and visions: those of the independent entrepreneur who was eager to get ahead; those of the professional who sought social and political legitimacy; and those of a jurisdiction that involved the use of "masculine" business professionalism to sell a commodity about which women were the acknowledged experts. The early struggle, manifested in debates at the annual conference and in the pages of the \_National Real Estate Journal\_, was to add professionalism to business; later debates centered on what women might bring to the field. What never aroused much debate was whether the federal government should build public housing. On this issue, red-blooded entrepreneurs and scientific professionals, male and female, circled the wagons. Parts of this story are familiar. The boundary between agents and developers was sometimes blurred and (as Hornstein is well aware) in his account of "community builders" Marc Weiss has discussed the influence of NAREB; elsewhere he has dealt with Ely.[1] Janet Hutchison includes NAREB in her survey of Hoover's housing propaganda of the 1920s, and several writers have included this group in their accounts of federal housing initiatives in the 1930s.[2] But Hornstein has woven these strands together in a novel way while adding elements that were hitherto unknown, and especially those that hint at the diversity within a group that some have treated as monolithic. For that reason this book will become a valuable reference work for anyone interested in the history of real estate and urban housing. The chief limitation of this work stems from Hornstein's reliance on association records, especially at the national level; on NAREB's own journal; and on other published works, including fiction. We see the real estate world through the eyes of the larger and more "progressive" realtors. Agents who were not realtors are invisible. (They were surely the great majority until at least the 1940s, though Hornstein does not offer an estimate.) Housing markets remain local to this day, and realtors spend more time dealing with buyers, builders, lenders, lawyers, and others in the local market than they do in the affairs of their associations. Hornstein alludes to this daily activity, but it is not his concern. As a result, his discussion of associational debates can wear thin. This is perhaps unavoidable for the formative years of the early 1900s, but less excusable for the postwar era. Even a few interviews could have thrown useful light on the attitudes and tensions associated with the feminization of the profession in the 1940s and 1950s. (And were there really so few contemporary studies of this trend?) By contrast, Hornstein's attempt to infer changes in the motivations of female realtors from the fictional life of "Suzy Soldsine" (196-199) fails to carry conviction. We need to know more about how agents fit into local housing markets; about the range of functions they performed, and how that changed; about how many switched from sales and marketing to land development and finance, about how many worked part-time, and about how these considerations affected their self-identification; about how many claimed or aspired to be "realtors"; and about how, in fact, men and women dealt differently with male and female clients. Hornstein does not address these questions. Usefully, he has provided us with a national narrative that provides a broad frame for local studies. But, given how much we still do not know about the operations of the average agent, it is inevitable that such studies will change this grand narrative. Notes [1].

With the exception of Gibbons et. al., to our knowledge this is the first analysis that examines whether housing markets are responsive to school value-added, which is important to understand given the increasing prevalence of value-added models in K-12 education and the increasing availability of these data for parents. Further, our identification strategy avoids known problems with boundary discontinuity papers such as sorting around the boundary that can lead to difficult to interpret local average treatment effects and difficulties with attributing differences in housing prices across boundaries to school quality or other correlates of school quality measures such as demographics. To estimate the impact of school value-added on housing prices, we use a unique and unanticipated release of value-added information for schools and teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). In August, 2010 the Los Angeles Times (LA Times) released valueadded estimates for 6,000 teachers in over 470 elementary schools in LAUSD on their website, which was easily accessed to the public and searchable by school and teacher.},

  abstract = {Because most children throughout the world attend elementary and secondary schools near their homes, where they live usually determines where they go to school. In the United States, the relationship between residential location and education has been especially strong given the dominance of local funding and local control of K–12 education. School quality varies markedly among the more than 14,000 school districts across the United States and within many of the country’s large urban districts. Housing prices reflect school quality; houses in better school districts or more advantaged neighborhoods of large districts sell at a premium. In other words, school quality is capitalized into the price of land.The chapters in this volume explore the links between education, location, and land based on the proceedings of the 8th Annual Land Policy Conference of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. Three policy outcomes are the focus: academic achievement of schoolchildren; racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic segregation; and equality of opportunity, all of which have broad relevance to U.S. public policy.~The topics include the expansion of school choice, especially through charter schools and home schooling; the importance of cognitive skills for economic growth; the role of the property tax in school finance and alternative revenue sources; the structure of school districts; transportation to school; effects of school location; and housing policies that can unlink education and location.This volume features the papers presented at the Lincoln Institute's 8th annual Land Policy Conference in June 2013.},

In May 1976, the Capitol Region Education Council received a grant from the Connecticut State Department of Education to implement a design for the evaluation of the 1975-76 Hartford Project Concern Program. Due to budgetary and time constraints, it was decided to focus upon two crucial areas, the cognitive and affective impact of Project Concern on program participants. A basic decision was made to evaluate student cognitive growth using a standardized commercially available reading test. It was further decided that the affective impact of Project Concern would be evaluated through a survey of the attitudes of students, suburban teachers, and suburban parents using questionnaires.

Student achievement in reading, language and mathematics is described, as are findings on participants' career aspirations, educational training, work history, and transition from school to work. Data indicate that suburban and inner city Project Concern participants were positively affected by the program in terms of career development and basic skills growth, although suburban students did not show positive relative growth. The reader is cautioned, however, that findings are tentative, due to low},

Project Concern began in September, 1966, as an experiment in educational intervention for children from Title I schools in the north end of Hartford, with emphasis on city-suburb cooperation in desegregtion. For this evaluation, the Metropolitan Achievement Tests in reading, language arts, and mathematics were administered to all program participants (516 suburban students in grades 2-10 and 139 inner-city students in grades 2-8). A student survey was used to measure participants' attitudes toward school and self-concept on a continuing basis. Findings showed the following: (1) Both suburban and inner-city participants tended to exhibit statistically significant basic skill growth in reading, mathematics, and language arts at most},

  abstract = {This quantitative study measures achievement differences between students who enrolled in Open Choice (a city-to-suburb voluntary school integration busing program, previously known as Project Concern, and a key remedy in the Sheff case), versus applicants who were not admitted by lottery. The study was based on 140 students who applied to enter the Choice program for the 1999-2000 academic year, in grades 5-8. Through the random lottery, 42 were accepted into the Choice program, while 98 remained in a control group. Using students' CMT scores, the author wrote the following: "In this study, I compare standardized achievement test scores of Choice and control students in order to estimate the effects of majority-to-minority transfer on the academic performance of Hartford students.  I find that treatment students perform better than controls in reading and, to a lesser extent, in math.  Writing scores, however, are lower for Choice students than for controls.  Although there is a trend toward more positive effects as the number of years in treatment increases, this change is largely the result of the movement of students between treatment and control after the initial allocation of groups.  When the sample is divided into lower- and higher-income groups, new patterns of achievement emerge.  Lower-income Choice students perform worse in all subject areas compared to lower-income controls.  Achievement for higher income students, however, appears to be affected more positively by participation in Open Choice, as these treatment students perform better than controls in both reading and math, though not in writing.  These findings suggest that while participation in the program academically benefits higher-income students, it has a more negative effect on the achievement of lower-income students.  Despite the intentions of policy makers, those students who are most disadvantaged do not appear to benefit from Open Choice. " p8-9},

Next, I will turn my attention to UConn’s recent history to consider how a series of policies, practices, and initiatives have diversified the undergraduate student body in the past thirty years. While the University has made considerable strides in admitting, retaining, and educating a student body that more proportionately reflects the demographics of the state population, a series of recent incidents reveals latent attitudes of racism, sexism, and the need for greater attention to fostering an inclusive campus climate. In the final section of the paper, I will conclude by considering the larger opportunities and challenges facing the future of UConn and how these factors reflect larger trends impacting contemporary higher education across the country.},

Yet Americans continue to hold deep-rooted beliefs in the principles of individualism, equal opportunity, and meritocracy. Education, the "Great Equalizer," is supposed to level the playing field, ensuring that every child—regardless of family of origin—gets an equal chance at success. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 200 black and white families, The American Dream and the Power of Wealth starkly reveals the enormous extent to which parents defend their beliefs in the values that lie at the heart of the American Dream. Yet the way wealth is acquired and the way it is used categorically puts children from different families on vastly different educational trajectories, leaving them with uneven sets of opportunities.},

In the first edition, Heather Beth Johnson explored this belief in the American Dream with over 200 in-depth interviews with black and white families, highlighting the ever-increasing racial wealth gap and the actual inequality in opportunities. This second edition has been updated to make it fully relevant to today’s reader, with new data and illustrative examples, including twenty new interviews. Johnson asks not just what parents are thinking about inequality and the American Dream, but to what extent children believe in the American Dream and how they explain, justify, and understand the stratification of American society. This book is an ideal addition to courses on race and inequality.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the long-run impacts of court-ordered school desegregation on an array of adult socioeconomic and health outcomes. The study analyzes the life trajectories of children born between 1945 and 1970, and followed through 2011, using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The PSID data are linked with multiple data sources that describe the neighborhood attributes, school quality resources, and coincident policies that prevailed at the time these children were growing up. I exploit quasirandom variation in the timing of initial court orders, which generated differences in the timing and scope of the implementation of desegregation plans during the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. Event study analyses as well as 2SLS and sibling-difference estimates indicate that school desegregation and the accompanied increases in school quality resulted in significant improvements in adult attainments for blacks. I find that, for blacks, school desegregation significantly increased both educational and occupational attainments, college quality and adult earnings, reduced the probability of incarceration, and improved adult health status; desegregation had no effects on whites across each of these outcomes. The results suggest that the mechanisms through which school desegregation led to beneficial adult attainment outcomes for blacks include improvement in access to school resources reflected in reductions in class size and increases in per-pupil spending.},

As schools were desegregated in the 1950s and 1960s, opponents feared that embracing students from low-performing all-black schools would lower standards and unfairly disrupt white students’ performances. In fact, as Rucker Johnson shows with his extensive research, desegregation had essentially no effect on white students, but propelled minority students to unprecedented levels of success. Rucker Johnson is an Associate Professor in the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley; a Faculty Research Fellow of the National Bureau of Economic Research; and a Research Affiliate of the National Poverty Center and the Institute for Research on Poverty. His research considers the role of poverty and inequality in affecting life chances. He has focused on such topics as the long-run impacts of child neighborhood and school quality on socioeconomic success and later-life health; the determinants of intergenerational mobility; the societal consequences of incarceration; effects of maternal employment patterns on child well-being; the socioeconomic determinants of health disparities over the life course; and the effects of growing up poor and poor infant health on childhood cognition, educational attainment, adult health and economic status.},

  abstract = {The primary community a child belongs to outside of her family is her school community. Under the best circumstances the school community positively contributes to a child’s socialization, academic outcomes,1 skill development,2 and social mobility. Schools can provide a platform for students and their families to build bonding and bridging social capital, and they act as stabilizing institutions that provide supportive social networks for families.3About 90 percent of American students are educated at public schools, and 9 percent at private schools.4 Public education has traditionally been tied directly to housing through residential assignment policies that assign homes to schools via school attendance zones. School zones are typically designed so that students attend schools near home, and despite growing opportunities to opt out or choose another school via charters, magnets, and public school open enrollment policies, 71 percent of students attend their assigned public school.5Families with children predictably take housing selection seriously, as housing often determines children’s access to educational opportunities. A nationally representative survey of homebuyers found half of households with children consider school district quality when selecting a neighborhood during home buying6 and a recent study found low-income families with Section 8 housing vouchers cited “better schools” as their primary motive for moving neighborhoods.7 However, many Americans say they are prevented f rom moving to a better neighborhood due to high housing costs.8This paper explores the relationship between housing and public education and finds the average U.S. ZIP code associated with the highest quality (A+) public elementary school has a 4-fold (\$486,104)  higher median home price than the average neighborhood associated with the lowest quality (D or less) public elementary schools (\$122,061).In a cross-city comparison, major cities with more restrictive residential zoning are less effective at providing high quality public education at a low, affordable price. Portland, Oregon features traditional residential assignment policies, restrictive residential zoning, and high, climbing average home values across increasing school quality levels.In contrast, Houston and Chicago, two major cities with less restrictive residential zoning, do a better job delivering access to high quality public schools than comparison cities with restrictive residential zoning, keeping home prices low and affordability high across school quality levels. As anticipated, cities with open enrollment or districtwide lotteries exhibit flatter relationships between home values and school quality.Since housing is the traditional gateway to public education, this paper suggests policymakers consider improving access to educational opportunity by minimizing residential zoning while expanding public school choice policies. Reforming residential zoning supports public school choice efforts by permitting a variety of housing throughout school zones, reducing prices, and improving affordability at every school quality level See also YouTube video explainer https://youtu.be/k2Nkv9YhGDI}

  abstract = {Almost fifty years ago the Coleman Report, widely regarded as the most important educational study of the twentieth century, found that the most powerful predictor of academic achievement is the socioeconomic status of a child's family. The second most important predictor is the socioeconomic status of the classmates in his or her school. Until very recently, the importance of this second finding has been consciously ignored by policymakers, and the national education debate has centered on trying to "fix" high-poverty schools by pouring greater resources into them, paying educators more to teach in them, or turning them into charter schools. At the local level, however, eighty school districts educating four million students now consciously seek to integrate schools by socioeconomic status. The Future of School Integration looks at how socioeconomic school integration has been pursued as a strategy to reduce the proportion of high-poverty schools and therefore to improve the performance of students overall. It examines whether students learn more in socioeconomically integrated schools —and pre-K programs —than in high-poverty institutions and explores the costs and benefits of integration programs. The book also investigates whether such integration is logistically and politically feasible, looking at the promises and pitfalls of both intradistrict and interdistrict integration programs. Finally, it examines the relevance of socioeconomic integration strategies being pursued by states and localities to the ongoing policy debates in Washington over efforts to turn around the nation's lowest-performing schools and to improve the quality of charter schools.Contributors include Stephanie Aberger (Expeditionary Learning), Marco Basile (Harvard University), Jennifer Jellison Holme (University of Texas–Austin), Ann Mantil (Harvard), Anne G.

Wise and energetic advocates such as Kahlenberg and Potter can take the charter movement in new and useful directions.”—The~Washington PostMoving beyond the debate over whether or not charter schools should exist,~A Smarter Charter~wrestles with the question of what kind of charter schools we should encourage. The authors begin by tracing the evolution of charter schools from teacher union leader Albert Shanker’s original vision of giving teachers room to innovate while educating a diverse population of students, to today’s charter schools where the majority of teachers are not unionized and student segregation levels are even higher than in traditional public schools. In the second half of the book, the authors examine two key reforms currently seen in a small but growing number of charter schools—teacher voice and socioeconomic integration—that have the potential to improve performance and reshape the stereotypical image of what it means to be a charter school.Important reading for policymakers, educators, researchers, and all citizens interested in the future of America’s public schools,~A Smarter Charter~features:  Profiles of charter schools that are bucking the prevailing trends, including their performance data and the challenges they face.  Best practices from successful charter schools, such as methods for attracting a diverse student body and examples of innovative teacher contracts.  Reform strategies that can improve student outcomes in a variety of public schools, not just charters.“Kahlenberg and Potter have delivered a thought-provoking, serious contribution. Agree or not with their views on the purpose and performance of charter schools, they have important things to say on where charters have been, where they need to go, and how they can get there. Friends and foes of charter schooling, alike, would do well to read this book.”—Frederick M.

  abstract = {The first part of this report explains the ways in which the U.S. Constitution provides federal authority to reduce harmful local zoning ordinances and reviews the evidence on three key reasons why the federal government should exercise its authority: (1) to reduce economic and racial segregation and discrimination; (2) to improve housing affordability and health; and (3) to fight climate change. The second part briefly reviews the experiences in several cities and states seeking exclusionary zoning reform, with a focus on Minneapolis, Oregon, California, and Virginia. This section asks what lessons local and state experiences hold for federal reform on questions such as how to build effective coalitions for reform; how to address the possibility that exclusionary zoning reform might inadvertently accelerate gentrification and displacement; and whether reforms should seek change that is incremental or bold. The third part outlines eight leading federal reform ideas, which include efforts to provide incentives for state and local reform through new funding carrots, attaching conditions to the receipt of existing federal funding, and employing a private right of action against government discrimination in federal court. Some of these ideas have already been endorsed by President Biden, others have not.24 The report discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each of these reforms based on three criteria: their potential effectiveness in bringing about change; their political viability (including the possibility of bipartisan support); and their constitutional viability to withstand possible challenges in federal court. Any of these approaches could be incorporated into key legislative vehicles for the Biden administration, including infrastructure and climate change bills. The fourth and final part of the report concludes with recommendations on the best paths forward for the Biden administration and Congress.},

  abstract = {The story of our separate and unequal America in the making, and one man’s fight against itDuring the long, hot summers of the late 1960s and 1970s, one man began a campaign to open some of America’s most exclusive beaches to minorities and the urban poor. That man was anti-poverty activist and one†‘time presidential candidate Ned Coll of Connecticut, a state that permitted public access to a mere seven miles of its 253†‘mile shoreline. Nearly all of the state’s coast was held privately, for the most part by white, wealthy residents.This book is the first to tell the story of the controversial protester who gathered a band of determined African American mothers and children and challenged the racist, exclusionary tactics of homeowners in a state synonymous with liberalism. Coll’s legacy of remarkable successes—and failures—illuminates how our nation’s fragile coasts have not only become more exclusive in subsequent decades but also have suffered greater environmental destruction and erosion as a result of that private ownership.},

However, are magnet schools really an effective solution to Sheff v. O’Neill? This in-depth study analyzes Hartford area school enrollment data, the low percentages of students attending these magnet schools, racial compositions of sending and receiving districts and the Capitol Region Education Council (CREC). The report concludes that Connecticut must spend more money on the magnet school program to make it a viable solution to the Sheff case.},

For the analysis, the Courant examined the percentage of students scoring at high achievement levels on the SBAC test (those who met or exceeded the target achievement level) and calculated how each district performed compared to the state average. We did the same thing for the CMT and CAPT tests in 2013 – the last year the tests were widely administered (looking at students deemed “at goal”). Then we looked at whether districts had improved their position relative to the state average, or whether they lost ground compared to the state as a whole.},

Second, I contend that wrestling with these tangled roots suggests the need for scholars to reexamine the role of private markets in shaping the organisation of educational opportunity across places and time. Third, I argue that histories like Oregon’s demonstrate that ‘state’ and ‘market’ are neither stable nor mutually exclusive categories.},

The FHA went far beyond merely approving of racial discrimination, and exploring the extent to which it did so is crucial to understanding the origins of urban racial inequality in America. Agency publications, many of them largely passed over by historians, called unequivocally for the containment of African Americans in the older residential neighborhoods where they were most likely to settle after migrating to the city. The agency then disguised its leadership in advancing a national segregationist agenda by deflecting blame onto the private market for policies that it had standardized and mandated. For nearly a decade after the Supreme Court invalidated one of its core racial programs, the FHA resisted providing greater opportunities for African Americans in the housing market.},

  abstract = {It has been nearly a half century since President Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty. Back in the 1960s tackling poverty "in place" meant focusing resources in the inner city and in rural areas. The suburbs were seen as home to middle- and upper-class families —affluent commuters and homeowners looking for good schools and safe communities in which to raise their kids. But today's America is a very different place. Poverty is no longer just an urban or rural problem, but increasingly a suburban one as well. In Confronting Suburban Poverty in America, Elizabeth Kneebone and Alan Berube take on the new reality of metropolitan poverty and opportunity in America.After decades in which suburbs added poor residents at a faster pace than cities, the 2000s marked a tipping point. Suburbia is now home to the largest and fastest-growing poor population in the country and more than half of the metropolitan poor. However, the antipoverty infrastructure built over the past several decades does not fit this rapidly changing geography. As Kneebone and Berube cogently demonstrate, the solution no longer fits the problem.The spread of suburban poverty has many causes, including shifts in affordable housing and jobs, population dynamics, immigration, and a struggling economy. The phenomenon raises several daunting challenges, such as the need for more (and better) transportation options, services, and financial resources. But necessity also produces opportunity —in this case, the opportunity to rethink and modernize services, structures, and procedures so that they work in more scaled, cross-cutting, and resource-efficient ways to address widespread need. This book embraces that opportunity.Kneebone and Berube paint a new picture of poverty in America as well as the best ways to combat it. Confronting Suburban Poverty in America offers a series of workable recommendations for public, private, and nonprofit leaders seeking to modernize poverty alleviation and community development strategies and connect residents with economic opportunity. The authors highlight efforts in metro areas where local leaders are learning how to do more with less and adjusting their approaches to address the metropolitan scale of poverty —for example, integrating services and service delivery, collaborating across sectors and jurisdictions, and using data-driven and flexible funding strategies."We believe the goal of public policy must be to provide all families with access to communities, whether in cities or suburbs, that offer a high quality of life and solid platform for upward mobility over time. Understanding the new reality of poverty in metropolitan America is a critical step toward realizing that goal." —from Chapter One},

From among a comparison group of 25 municipalities that were similar to Springfield in 1960, the study identifies 10 "resurgent cities" that have made substantial progress in improving living standards for their residents, and that are recognized as vital communities in a broader sense by experts on urban economic development and policy. These case studies suggest that industry mix, demographic composition, and geographic position are not the key factors distinguishing the resurgent cities from Springfield. Instead, the most important lessons from the resurgent cities concern leadership and collaboration. Initial leadership in these cities came from a variety of key institutions and individuals. In some cases, the turnaround started with efforts on the part of the public sector, while in other cases nongovernmental institutions or private developers were at the forefront. Regardless of who initiated the turnaround, economic redevelopment efforts spanned decades and involved collaborations among numerous organizations and sectors. comparison of economic development strategies in "resurgent cities": Evansville, Fort Wayne, Grand Rapids, Greensboro, Jersey City, New Haven, Peoria, Providence, Winston-Salem, Worcester, and some comparisons to Hartford, Syracuse},

During the New Deal, federal agencies like the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation and the Federal Housing Administration encouraged redlining practices that explicitly marked minority neighborhoods as risky investments and therefore discouraged bank loans, mortgages and insurance there. Other policies simply targeted black communities for isolation and demolition. The postwar programs for urban renewal, for instance, destroyed black neighborhoods and displaced their residents with such regularity that African-Americans came to believe, in James Baldwin’s memorable phrase, that “urban renewal means Negro removal.” "},

  abstract = {"America has become a nation of suburbs. Confronting the popular image of suburbia as simply a refuge for affluent whites, The New Suburban History rejects the stereotypes of a conformist and conflict-free suburbia. The seemingly calm streets of suburbia were, in fact, battlegrounds over race, class, and politics. With this collection, Kevin Kruse and Thomas Sugrue argue that suburbia must be understood as a central factor in the modern American experience.  Kruse and Sugrue here collect ten essays—augmented by their provocative introduction—that challenge our understanding of suburbia. Drawing from original research on suburbs across the country, the contributors recast important political and social issues in the context of suburbanization. Their essays reveal the role suburbs have played in the transformation of American liberalism and conservatism; the contentious politics of race, class, and ethnicity; and debates about the environment, land use, and taxation. The contributors move the history of African Americans, Latinos, Asians, and blue-collar workers from the margins to the mainstream of suburban history. From this broad perspective, these innovative historians explore the way suburbs affect—and are affected by—central cities, competing suburbs, and entire regions. The results, they show, are far-reaching: the emergence of a suburban America has reshaped national politics, fostered new social movements, and remade the American landscape. The New Suburban History offers nothing less than a new American history—one that claims the nation cannot be fully understood without a history of American suburbs at its very center."

Are these neighborhood preferences color‐blind or race conscious? Does neighborhood racial composition have a net influence upon preferences, or is race a proxy for social class? This article tests the racial proxy hypothesis using an innovative experiment that isolates the net effects of race and social class, followed by an analysis of the social psychological factors associated with residential preferences. The authors find that net of social class, the race of a neighborhood’s residents significantly influenced how it was rated. Whites said the all‐white neighborhoods were most desirable. The independent effect of racial composition was smaller among blacks, who identified the racially mixed neighborhood as most desirable. Further, whites who held negative stereotypes about African‐Americans and the neighborhoods where they live were significantly influenced by neighborhood racial composition. None of the proposed social psychological factors conditioned African‐Americans' sensitivity to neighborhood racial composition.},

It is one region, but separate worlds. And it was designed to be that way. In this deeply reported, revelatory story, duPont Award–winning journalist Lawrence Lanahan chronicles how the region became so highly segregated and why its fault lines persist today. Mark and Nicole personify the enormous disparities in access to safe housing, educational opportunities, and decent jobs. As they eventually pack up their lives and change places, bold advocates and activists—in the courts and in the streets—struggle to figure out what it will take to save our cities and communities: Put money into poor, segregated neighborhoods? Make it possible for families to move into areas with more opportunity? The Lines Between Us is a riveting narrative that compels reflection on America’s entrenched inequality—and on where the rubber meets the road not in the abstract, but in our own backyards. Taking readers from church sermons to community meetings to public hearings to protests to the Supreme Court to the death of Freddie Gray, Lanahan deftly exposes the intricacy of Baltimore’s hypersegregation through the stories of ordinary people living it, shaping it, and fighting it, day in and day out. This eye-opening account of how a city creates its black and white places, its rich and poor spaces, reveals that these problems are not intractable; but they are designed to endure until each of us—despite living in separate worlds—understands we have something at stake.},

Using Atlanta as a lens to view the wider nation, LeeAnn Lands shows how assumptions about race and class have coalesced with attitudes toward residential landscape aesthetics and home ownership to shape public policies that promote and protect white privilege. Lands studies the diffusion of property ideologies on two separate but related levels: within academic, professional, and bureaucratic circles and within circles comprising civic elites and rank-and-file residents. By the 1920s, following the establishment of park neighborhoods such as Druid Hills and Ansley Park, white home owners approached housing and neighborhoods with a particular collection of desires and sensibilities: architectural and landscape continuity, a narrow range of housing values, orderliness, and separation from undesirable land uses—and undesirable people. By the 1950s, these desires and sensibilities had been codified in federal, state, and local standards, practices, and laws. Today, Lands argues, far more is at stake than issues of access to particular neighborhoods, because housing location is tied to the allocation of a broad range of resources, including school funding, infrastructure, and law enforcement. Long after racial segregation has been outlawed, white privilege remains embedded in our culture of home ownership.},

  abstract = {A series of policy shifts over the past decade promises to change how Americans decide where to send their children to school. In theory, the expanded use of standardized test scores and the boom in charter schools will allow parents to evaluate their assigned neighborhood school, or move in search of a better option. But what kind of data do parents actually use while choosing schools? Are there differences among suburban and urban families? How do parents choices influence school and residential segregation? Choosing Homes, Choosing Schools presents a breakthrough analysis of the new era of school choice, and what it portends for American neighborhoods. The distinguished contributors to Choosing Homes, Choosing Schools investigate the complex relationships among education, neighborhood social networks, and larger patterns of inequality. Paul Jargowsky reviews recent trends in segregation by race and class, and shows that while segregation between blacks and whites has declined overall since 1970, white parents are still more likely to choose to live in predominantly white neighborhoods. This skewed residential selection in turn drives racial inequality in public schools. Annette Lareau draws on interviews with parents in three suburban neighborhoods to analyze school-choice decisions. Surprisingly, she finds that middle- and upper-class parents do not rely on active research, such as school tours or test scores. Instead, their decision-making was largely informal and passive, with most simply trusting advice from friends and others in their network. Elliot Weinginer looks at how class differences among urban parents affect their approaches to choosing schools. He finds that while parents of all backgrounds actively consider their children s education choices, middle- and upper-class parents relied more on federally mandated school report cards, district websites, and online forums, while working-class parents used network contacts to gain information on school quality. Amy Schwartz and Leanna Stiefel explore the connections between housing policy and education reform. They demonstrate the shortcomings of policies focused exclusively on school choice or the practice of allowing students to cross district boundaries to better schools and instead advocate for reducing educational inequality by expanding residential choice through measures such as housing subsidies and the redevelopment of public housing to include schools and community centers. Little previous research has explored what role school concerns play in the preferences of white and minority parents for particular neighborhoods, and how the racial and economic makeup of both neighborhoods and schools mutually reinforce each other. Choosing Homes, Choosing Schools adroitly addresses this gap and provides a firmer understanding of how Americans choose where to live and send their children to school.},

  abstract = {After Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans eliminated default neighborhood schools and began to require parents to choose a school for their child. There are many new schools and a new enrollment process, making accurate and comprehensive information essential. Is one’s information source related to satisfaction in their choices? Psychological theories suggest that more information may not always be better; people can be overwhelmed and actually make suboptimal choices. I show that a greater reliance on comprehensive sources is related to less confidence that one’s child got into their top choice school, while those parents who use shortcuts, such as social networks and/or school advertising, are more satisfied that they made the right choice. Information sources are not, however, related to the likelihood of enrolling one’s child in a high performing school. Rather, the school performance score is predicted by race and socioeconomic class.},

The literature review and data analysis identify the key factors that seem to have contributed to bifurcated patterns in achievement gaps. The conventional measures of socioeconomic and family conditions, youth culture and student behavior, and schooling conditions and practices might account for some of the achievement gap trends for a limited time period or for a particular racial and ethnic group. However, they do not fully capture the variations. This preliminary analysis of covariations in racial and ethnic gap patterns across several large data sets has implications for future research on the achievement of minority groups.},

  abstract = {Nestled in neighborhoods of varying degrees of affluence, suburban public schools are typically better resourced than their inner-city peers and known for their extracurricular offerings and college preparatory programs. Despite the glowing opportunities that many families associate with suburban schooling, accessing a district's resources is not always straightforward, particularly for black and poorer families. Moving beyond class- and race-based explanations, Inequality in the Promised Land focuses on the everyday interactions between parents, students, teachers, and school administrators in order to understand why resources seldom trickle down to a district's racial and economic minorities.Rolling Acres Public Schools (RAPS) is one of the many well-appointed suburban school districts across the United States that has become increasingly racially and economically diverse over the last forty years. Expanding on Charles Tilly's model of relational analysis and drawing on 100 in-depth interviews as well participant observation and archival research, R. L'Heureux Lewis-McCoy examines the pathways of resources in RAPS. He discovers that—due to structural factors, social and class positions, and past experiences—resources are not valued equally among families and, even when deemed valuable, financial factors and issues of opportunity hoarding often prevent certain RAPS families from accessing that resource. In addition to its fresh and incisive insights into educational inequality, this groundbreaking book also presents valuable policy-orientated solutions for administrators, teachers, activists, and politicians.},

Drawing from educational, historical, and sociological literatures, I argue that an underconsideration of suburban space has left many portraits of educational inequality incomplete. The article outlines the emergence of American suburbs and the formation of the city suburb divide which governs much framing of educational inequality and why this frame has limited thinking about what suburbs are and who lies within them. I follow with a discussion of the contemporary state of the suburbs which are now often more racially, ethnically, and economically diverse than their proximal central cities. There are a variety of suburb types, and this article explores three: majority–minority suburbs, exclusive enclaves, and gateway communities. Each suburb type leads to unique challenges such as demographic mismatch between leadership and school population to considering how ethnicity and race interact with Afro-Latino communities. A discussion of how racialized poverty in suburbia shapes the school and social experiences of Black youth is offered. The article closes with the consideration of the directions researchers should consider and areas of policy that are ripe for reengagement given the diversity of Black experiences in suburban schools.},

  abstract = {On the surface, Riverview High School looks like the post-racial ideal. Serving an enviably affluent, diverse, and liberal district, the school is well-funded, its teachers are well-trained, and many of its students are high achieving. Yet Riverview has not escaped the same unrelenting question that plagues schools throughout America: why is it that even when all of the circumstances seem right, black and Latino students continue to lag behind their peers? Through five years' worth of interviews and data-gathering at Riverview, John Diamond and Amanda Lewis have created a rich and disturbing portrait of the achievement gap that persists more than fifty years after the formal dismantling of segregation. As students progress from elementary school to middle school to high school, their level of academic achievement increasingly tracks along racial lines, with white and Asian students maintaining higher GPAs and standardized testing scores, taking more advanced classes, and attaining better college admission results than their black and Latino counterparts. Most research to date has focused on the role of poverty, family stability, and other external influences in explaining poor performance at school, especially in urban contexts. Diamond and Lewis instead situate their research in a suburban school, and look at what factors within the school itself could be causing the disparity. Most crucially, they challenge many common explanations of the 'racial achievement gap,' exploring what race actually means in this situation, and why it matters. An in-depth study with far-reaching consequences, Despite the Best Intentions revolutionizes our understanding of both the knotty problem of academic disparities and the larger question of the color line in American society.},

  abstract = {The debate about racial residential preferences has two open questions. First, are neighborhood racial preferences truly racial, or is race a proxy for socio-economic factors? Second, are in-group or out-group preferences more salient? Using the Houston Area Survey, we employ a factorial experiment to assess the effect of racial composition on neighborhood desirability independent of crime, school quality and property values. We survey whites, blacks and Hispanics to examine in-group vs. out-group preferences. Results show that independent of proxies, whites find neighborhoods less attractive as the proportion black or Hispanic increases; the proportion Asian has no impact. Racial composition has little effect on Hispanics' and blacks' neighborhood preferences. We find no evidence of in-group preferences; rather, results suggest that whites express negative out-group preferences toward black and Hispanic neighborhoods.},

He said previous studies have shown that more than 40 percent of Hartford children go to bed hungry and that an additional 30 percent are at risk of hunger. One reason that Hartford often stands out in national studies on poverty is that it is relatively small geographically, and wealthy areas - such as West Hartford - are nearby but outside its city limits. In some cities with poverty comparable to Hartford's, such wealthy areas are part of the city.},

Using qualitative and quantitative methods to examine the construction of ?neighborhood risk? reveals how, from the introduction of the agency?s underwriting standards, raters depended on a more nuanced population classification scheme in evaluating urban areas. The evidence presented here about the differential treatment of nationality groups points to new directions for studies of housing policy in the United States.},

Laredo just hit 100,000 people for the first time, so it was not included in the rankings a decade ago. Detroit, Gary, Cleveland and Dayton were all among the top 30-poorest cities in 1980. Flint -- known nationally for its automobile factory shutdowns -- jumped from the 55th-poorest city a decade ago to the nation's fifth-poorest. During the 1980s, per capita income in Hartford grew nearly 20 percent faster than inflation. The average city resident earned \$5,559 in 1979, which would be \$9,314 in 1989 dollars. But per capita income had grown to \$11,081 in Hartford by 1989, according to the census.},

  abstract = {The United States is more diverse than ever before. Increased immigration has added to a vibrant cultural fabric, and women and minorities have made significant strides in overcoming overt discrimination. At the same time, economic inequality has increased significantly in recent decades, and the Great Recession substantially weakened the economic standing not only of the poor but also of the middle class. \emph{Diversity and Disparities,} edited by sociologist John Logan, assembles impressive new studies that interpret the social and economic changes in the United States over the last decade. The authors, leading social scientists from many disciplines, analyze changes in the labor market, family structure, immigration, and race. They find that while America has grown more diverse, the opportunities available to disadvantaged groups have become more unequal.  Drawing on detailed data from the decennial census, the American Community Survey, and other sources, the authors chart the growing diversity and the deepening disparities among different groups in the United States Harry J. Holzer and Marek Hlavac document that although the economy always rises and falls over the business cycle, the Great Recession of 2007-2009 was a catastrophic event that saw record levels of unemployment, especially among less-educated workers, young people, and minorities. Emily Rosenbaum shows how the Great Recession amplified disparities in access to home ownership, and demonstrates that young adults, especially African Americans, are falling behind previous cohorts not only in home ownership and wealth but even in starting their own families and households.  Sean F. Reardon and Kendra Bischoff explore the rise of class segregation as higher-income Americans are moving away from others into separate and privileged neighborhoods and communities. Immigration has also seen class polarization, with an increase in both highly skilled workers and undocumented immigrants. As Frank D. Bean and his colleagues show, the lack of a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants inhibits the educational and economic opportunities for their children and grandchildren. Barrett Lee and colleagues demonstrate that the nation and most cities and towns are becoming more diverse by race and ethnicity. However, while black-white segregation is slowly falling, Hispanics and Asians remain as segregated today as they were in 1980.   \emph{Diversity and Disparities} raises concerns about the extent of socioeconomic immobility in the United States today. This volume provides valuable information for policymakers, journalists, and researchers seeking to understand the current state of the nation.},

Prejudice can be birthed from a lack of understanding the historically accurate details of the past. Without being aware of the unconstitutional residential policies the United States government enacted during the middle of the twentieth century, one might have a negative view today of neighborhoods where African Americans live or even of African Americans themselves.  We can compensate for this unlawful segregation through a national political consensus that leads to legislation. And this will only happen if the majority of Americans understand how we got here. Like Jay-Z said in a recent New York Times interview, “you can't have a solution until you start dealing with the problem: What you reveal, you heal.” This is the major challenge at hand: to educate fellow citizens of the unconstitutional inequality that we’ve woven and, on behalf of our government, accept responsibility to fix it.}

Originally a two-year experiment called Project Concern, the purpose of this bussing program was to desegregate Hartford’s schools and to combat the enormous racial and economic imbalances between Hartford and the surrounding suburban towns.  Project Concern was established in 1966 in the midst of President Johnson’s Great Society legislation and reforms, and was a product of the idealism and experimental environment of the mid-1960s.  This paper focuses on the origins of Project Concern within that environment, the struggles it endured to persist, and the student outcomes following the first two years of the program, from 1966-1968.},

  abstract = {see also full volume obtained digital draft from author ABSTRACT: Although there are many, often competing, justifications for school choice, almost all are premised on the notion that parents are to be empowered to select the best schools for their children. While this assumption derives from economic theory, it too often devolves into an ideological debate regarding whether or not parents are able to choose a school in their child’s best interests. This analysis examines two types of arguments that parents are necessarily the most effective advocates for their children’s educational interests: first, a philosophical contention that parents are necessarily best positioned to exercise primary responsibility over their children’s education; and secondly, an empirical claim that parents choose schools based on evidence of academic quality. The analysis finds each of these claims to be problematic in light of evidence on the dynamics of school choice in the real-world context. Instead of debating whether or not parents can choose the best schools, I argue that the appropriate question is whether the requisite knowledge or information is widely available and equitably distributed through mechanisms of choice and competition. To that end, I introduce a framework for considering types of information that could be employed in selecting a school. A short empirical exercise demonstrates that more useful types of information are least likely to be available to parents.},

  abstract = {Competition sparked by school choice is expected to generate greater educational opportunities, particularly for disadvantaged students. The premise is that competitive incentives will change the organizational behavior of schools (and districts, dioceses, etc.) in ways that will lead to more equitable access for students across varied and often segregated urban landscapes. Drawing from theories of institutional environments and nonprofit firms, this analysis investigates patterns of access across three highly competitive local education markets to determine how school choices are arranged as options expand. The findings indicate that competitive incentives can have similar impacts on different types of organizations, but both policy variations and contextual factors such as demographic distributions may also play critical roles in shaping the market structures in which schools operate. Notably, all three cases showed patterns of exclusionary strategies that schools embraced to enhance market position.},

  abstract = {'Which school should I choose for my child?' For many parents, this question is one of the most important of their lives. 'School choice' is a slogan being voiced around the globe, conjuring images of a marketplace with an abundance of educational options. Those promoting educational choice also promise equality, social advantage, autonomy, and self-expression to families. But what does this globalisation of school choice actually look like on the ground? This collection brings together educationalists, anthropologists, and sociologists who use a rich array of empirical data to understand the complex realities of school choice across a range of political and social settings: in Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, England, India, Israel, Japan, Singapore, Tanzania, and the United States. Together they show that, while the language of school choice has spread globally, it has done so unevenly across and within nations, and is always interpreted through local social and historical contexts. Neo-liberal policy initiatives are re-shaping education systems in many nations, but in complex and varied ways. This collection shows that rather than eliminating equity concerns, they re-embed them within new frameworks of choice and accountability. This is an important book for those interested in comparative education, as well as the sociology and politics of schooling. CONTENTS Acknowledgements Martin Forsey, Scott Davies \& Geoffrey Walford.

We called these "success story schools." Nearly a year into the project, two schools emerged as clear models of success. They were places where kids were succeeding beyond what demographics or zip code would predict, and they were institutions that seemed to offer lessons about leadership and learning that could inform statewide policymaking. One was Dwight Elementary, a traditional district school in Hartford that had undergone a dramatic turnaround under the leadership of principal Kathy Greider. The other was Amistad Academy, a public charter school in New Haven founded by Dacia Toll, whose students consistently outperformed their peers from other schools. Response on SmartChoices},

  abstract = {Local planning in the United States is unique in the amount of land it reserves for detached single-family homes. This privileging of single-family homes, normally called R1 zoning, exacerbates inequality and undermines efficiency. R1’s origins are unpleasant: Stained by explicitly classist and implicitly racist motivations, R1 today continues to promote exclusion. It makes it harder for people to access high-opportunity places, and in expensive regions it contributes to shortages of housing, thereby benefiting homeowners at the expense of renters and forcing many housing consumers to spend more on housing. Stacked against these drawbacks, moreover, are a series of only weak arguments in R1’s favor about preferences, aesthetics, and a single-family way of life. We demonstrate that these pro-R1 concerns are either specious, or can be addressed in ways less socially harmful than R1. Given the strong arguments against R1 and the weak arguments for it, we contend planners should work to abolish R1 single-family zoning.},

  abstract = {American banks, to their eternal discredit, long played a key role in disenfranchising nonwhite urbanites and, through redlining, blighting the very city neighborhoods that needed the most investment. Banks long showed little compunction in aiding and abetting blockbusting, discrimination, and outright theft from nonwhites. They denied funds to entire neighborhoods or actively exploited them, to the benefit of suburban whites--an economic white flight to sharpen the pain caused by the demographic one.  And yet, the dynamic between banks and urban communities was not static, and positive urban development, supported by banks, became possible. In After Redlining, Rebecca K. Marchiel illuminates how, exactly, urban activists were able to change some banks' behavior to support investment in communities that they had once abandoned. The leading activists arose in an area hit hard by banks' discriminatory actions and politics: Chicago's West Side. A multiracial coalition of low-and moderate-income city residents, this Saul Alinsky-inspired group championed urban reinvestment. And amazingly, it worked: their efforts inspired national action, culminating in the federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and the Community Reinvestment Act. \mbox{} While the battle for urban equity goes on, After Redlining provides a blueprint of hope.},

  author = {McDermott, Kathryn},
  date = {2015-04-19},
  abstract = {Boston was under a desegregation order from 1974 to 1990. The city continued controlled choice for elementary and middle school, with racial balance criteria until 1999, when it dropped the racial-balance criteria but continued choice. In the system that was in place through the 2013-14 school year, students chose schools within three large zones, and with priority for 50\% of each school’s seats for students who lived within walking distance. Many Bostonians were unsatisfied with the system, because they could not predict where their children would be enrolled, and because students often had long bus rides to schools that were not necessarily better or more diverse than their other options would have been. However, efforts to change the student assignment policy in 2004 and 2009 failed because participants could not agree on a better system. This impasse ended in 2013, when the Boston School Committee voted to eliminate all school zones and instead use a computer algorithm for student assignment. The algorithm generates a set of choices for each address in the city, which includes the 6 closest schools and then pulls in more distant schools if necessary to ensure that each choice set includes at least 2 schools in the city’s top performance quartile and 2 in the second quartile (Boston Public Schools 2013). This paper is grounded in prior research on the politics of race and urban schooling (Henig et al,. 1999; Author, in press) in mayor-controlled school districts (Henig \& Rich, 2004). We examine why the stalemate over Boston student assignment ended, and why the city adopted this particular, innovative approach to student assignment. Data for the analysis are drawn from interviews with participants, media accounts, and observation of public meetings connected with the process. We conclude that three factors enabled approval of the new policy. First, because the new policy uses a choice algorithm rather than attendance zones, its effects on access to better schools were harder to predict in advance, and less immediately visible. Earlier proposals had redrawn lines on a map, which made it quite visible that students in some neighborhoods would have less access to better-performing schools. Second, many participants believed that promoting diversity in schools (one of the goals of the previous policy) was no longer a relevant goal in a school system whose students are 87\% students of color. Finally, getting students into schools closer to their homes had long been a goal of the city’s popular mayor, who was in his final term. The paper’s main contribution is to analyze how race-blind policies may perpetuate racial inequality; it also illustrates the complexity of racial issues in a mayorally controlled school district.},

The grant was designed in a way that gave school districts significant discretion over the types of technical assistance and the consultants that would support their projects. Eleven school districts received funding from the TASAP grant. The districts faced common challenges, in particular, financial austerity, declining enrollments, and pressure to reduce achievement gaps between racial and socioeconomic groups. The most common topics of technical assistance were public engagement, including marketing and community forums, and geospatial analysis. Most of the districts that used TASAP funds to continue existing policies maintained an emphasis on diversity. On the other hand, most of the districts that used TASAP to help change their student assignment policies moved away from diversity as a priority. Districts that had expressed a commitment to diversity in their TASAP applications could not necessarily sustain those commitments in the face of competition with other local interests and needs. Federal management of the grant did not provide leverage on districts to ensure that the local work remained true to its initial goals. We present six recommendations for future federal diversity policy, based on the TASAP experience: 1. Construct a more deliberate theory of change so that all elements of the grant, including the proposal evaluation criteria and funded activities, are aligned. 2. Solicit grant proposals for a longer period of time. 3. Include inter-district approaches to diversity. 4. Provide sufficient federal involvement and guidance to support project implementation at the local level, and increase accountability for federal program goals. 5. Build on local capacity. 6. Situate diversity as central to educational improvement to increase the relevance of diversity programs.},

Data were obtained from the Connecticut State Department of Education, three of the state's Regional Educational Service Centers, and interviews with education officials. The results indicate that, from the state's viewpoint, desegregation programs are small because they are part of an overall, gradual strategy and are designed to fit within the legal limitations on desegregation remedies posed by recent federal court decisions. However, from the Sheff plaintiffs' viewpoint, the small size of the programs shows that state policymakers lack any real will to exercise leadership on school integration. It is concluded that the overall effect of the state's voluntary desegregation policies has been to subsidize further racial isolation in the inner cities and minimal diversity in the suburbs." attached -- additional open choice data tables that are no longer on website},

This article presents case studies of politics and student assignment policy in three large school districts: Boston, Massachusetts; Wake County (Raleigh), North Carolina; and Jefferson County (Louisville), Kentucky. In all three districts, there has been pressure to change student-assignment policies in ways that respond to the priorities of White and middle-class populations, with the potential to worsen the options available to students of color. Our case studies reinforce the criticisms of race-neutral politics and policy that have been made by Eduardo Bonilla-Silva and others. Race-neutral politics during fiscal retrenchment tends to reframe privilege as common sense and to obscure some students’ structural disadvantages.},

A number of past policies, promoted by both private and federal interests, encouraged racial segregation. Although these explicitly racist policies are no longer legal, research shows that their legacy often persists well beyond their termination. For example, historical data reveals long-term patterns of inequality that can be traced back to racist zoning codes of the past. Of the housing barriers that ethnic minorities within the US have faced in the 20th century, “redlining” is perhaps the most talked about—and for good reason. Redlining is the nickname given to the practice of rating certain neighborhoods as undesirable investment choices due to their racial and socioeconomic demographics. Banks then used these ratings when determining whether or not to authorize loan transactions for home purchases and improvements in those communities. By effectively directing capital investment away from “redlined” neighborhoods, this practice shaped the demographic patterns as well as the built environments of cities and suburbs across the US.

The United States government funded these developments; therefore, local housing officials needed to abide by federal laws regarding occupancy. Federal Housing authorities eventually did require West Hartford to admit African Americans; however, town residents and leaders prevailed by specifying residency criteria in such a way as to maintain the demographic makeup of their virtually all-white community.

However, HOLC did not embark on its now infamous mapping project until after it had issued all its emergency refinancing loans to the nation’s struggling homeowners. We examine the racial logic of HOLC’s local operations and its lending record to black applicants during the agency’s initial 1933-1935 “rescue” phase, finding black access to its loans to have been far more extensive than anyone has assumed. Yet, even though HOLC did loan to African Americans, it did so in ways that reinforced racial segregation—and with the objective of replenishing the working capital of the overwhelmingly white-owned building and loans that held the mortgages on most black-owned homes.},

Yet much of this scholarship has downplayed black agency and tended to portray African Americans as victims of structural forces beyond their control. In this history of Cleveland's black middle class, Todd Michney uncovers the creative ways that members of this nascent community established footholds in areas outside the overcrowded, inner-city neighborhoods to which most African Americans were consigned. In asserting their right to these outer-city spaces, African Americans appealed to city officials, allied with politically progressive whites (notably Jewish activists), and relied upon both black and white developers and real estate agents to expand these "surrogate suburbs" and maintain their livability until the bona fide suburbs became more accessible.By tracking the trajectories of those who, in spite of racism, were able to succeed, Michney offers a valuable counterweight to histories that have focused on racial conflict and black poverty and tells the neglected story of the black middle class in America's cities prior to the 1960s.},

During the 1980s, Charlotte elites abandoned support for busing, \& in 1992, mandatory busing was replaced with a voluntary system based on magnet schools, fulfilling the wishes of most white \& some African-American parents. The abandonment of active desegregation occurred in a national context of criticism of desegregation, criticism of public education in general, attacks on the poor by the Right, middle class fears of economic restructuring \& decline, \& the redefinition of at-risk children as social problems. Local concerns focused on maximizing educational benefits for middle class children \& creating a climate that would attract business to the area. 1 Table, 3 Figures, 73 References. E. Blackwell},

  abstract = {Schools have a seminal role in preparing a society’s children for their adult responsibilities as workers, parents, friends, neighbors, and citizens. The United States, countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Brazil, India, South Africa, and other multiethnic democratic nation-states have increasingly diverse demographic profiles that present challenges and opportunities for social cohesion. The focus of this chapter is the relationship between integrated schooling and social cohesion in nations such as these. The chapter’s central thesis is that schools that are racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse lead to educational outcomes that undergird the attitudinal antecedents to and structural conditions for social cohesion in multiethnic, democratic societies. Using the United States as a case study, the chapter synthesizes educational, social, and behavioral science research on the effects of school racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic status (SES) composition on various adult life course outcomes that are crucial to this condition. It is necessary to explore this topic using the United States as a case study because the English language literature on integrated schooling, life course outcomes, and social cohesion in other multiethnic democracies is rather limited. Before reviewing the relevant literature on this relationship, it is necessary to problematize the concepts of democracy and social cohesion, both of which have multiple contested meanings. We do not employ the constructs of democracy and social cohesion uncritically. Although a full explication of the nuanced and complicated nature of the debates surrounding social cohesion and democracy is not possible in this chapter, it is important to acknowledge that simplistic conceptualizations of either democracy or social cohesion obscure—rather than illuminate—the social forces under consideration.},

  abstract = {"This thesis will seek to uncover the many reasons why the Sheff v. O’Neill decision  remains largely unfulfilled 17 years later. Despite a court order to provide integration and years  of research that suggest that removing children from racially isolated schools is beneficial, the  political will to make the necessary changes has never materialized. A review of the research and  progress since the decision was first announced suggests that this failure stems from a lack of  incentivization for all of the major parties whose support would be necessary to turn the Sheff  decision into a reality. Neither the state, the city, nor the suburbs see integration as a particularly  appealing objective, and due to the nature of the Court’s decision, few measures are in place to  incentivize their cooperation or punish their inaction. Students and parents undoubtedly have the most to gain from integration yet they have the least amount of power to influence the situation"},

  abstract = {Public charter schools, interdistrict magnet schools, and the Open Choice program are collectively called Choice programs. One of their key missions is to improve educational outcomes of historically underperforming students from Connecticut’s urban public schools. This analysis examines the academic growth and outcome performance based on the Connecticut Mastery Tests (CMT) for Choice program attendees from Connecticut’s four largest cities—Bridgeport, Hartford, New Haven, and Waterbury—over a two-year period (2010 to 2012). To conduct the most effective examination of ex post facto or pre-existing data where random assignment is either impossible or unethical (Murnane, R.J. and Willett, J.B., 2011), 30 stratified random samples of quasi-controls were generated from the co-present population of CMT test-takers. Then, the academic results for urban Choice program attendees were compared with results from the 30 samples. To counter known biasing influences such as higher baseline test performance, these quasi-control samples were matched with their respective Choice program “treatment group” on baseline test performance as well as on student background characteristics known to be related to test performance (Behuniak, P., Mooney, R. F., Cloud, R., 1990). Results for each Choice program group and its respective quasi-control groups were tracked and compared longitudinally for the same students in two grade cohorts: 1. Grade 3 in 2010 to Grade 5 in 2012 2. Grade 6 in 2010 to Grade 8 in 2012 The use of longitudinal data allows us to ascribe academic performance gains over time to the educational interventions that have taken place; additionally, comparing gains achieved by the Choice program groups to their respective quasi-control groups enables us to control for gains that might have occurred naturally due to student maturation. In the Grades 3 to 5 cohort, the analysis reveals statistically meaningful gains at or above the CMT Proficient level in interdistrict magnet schools operated by regional educational service centers (RESCs) and for the Open Choice program, and nearly statistically meaningful gains at or above the CMT Goal level for the RESC-operated interdistrict magnet schools. In the Grades 6 to 8 cohort, public charter schools alone showed statistically meaningful gains at or above Proficient and Goal levels on the CMT. This study remains an ex post facto, or “after the fact” analysis, thus not allowing causal attribution of the program outcomes. Hence, in practice it cannot be said with certainty that clones of these Choice programs, or an exportation of specific pedagogical techniques and strategies used, will necessarily ensure similar performance successes for urban students in general.},

  abstract = {"This thesis is an analysis of Career and Technical Education as a response to the low quality of public education in Hartford, Connecticut. Hartford Public Schools recently adopted the Career Academy model of CTE to restructure its failing high schools. This model is an improvement upon traditional forms of CTE, and graduation rates and test scores have increased since Hartford’s Academies opened in 2008. Still, whether Career Academies are an appropriate solution to the chronic underperformance of the city’s schools will depend upon their compatibility with the broader educational policies being implemented by the district and the State. The two primary policies to consider are school choice at the district level and desegregation at the state level. Career Academies are not perfectly compatible with either of these broader agendas. However, school choice and desegregation measures have their own limitations that will prevent them from generating lasting improvements. For either policy to work, Hartford will need high-performing local schools, yet neither school choice nor desegregation can create these schools on its own. Policy recommendations are offered for making Career Academies more compatible with the district’s and the State’s agendas in order for all systems to operate more effectively. Ultimately, Hartford’s history of racial and economic concentration needs to be reversed in order to achieve long-term success. Doing so can only be accomplished if the city has high-quality local schools with which to attract a diverse population, and Career Academies offer significant promise to fill this role at the high school level."

  abstract = {School choice policies, a fixture of efforts to improve public education in many cities, aim to enable families to choose a school that they believe will best meet their child's needs. In New York City (NYC), choice and the development of a diverse portfolio of options have played central roles in the Department of Education's high school reform efforts. This report examines the choices and placements of New York City's lowest-achieving students: those scoring among the bottom 20 percent on standardized state tests in middle school. Focusing on data from 2007 to 2011, the report looks at who these low-achieving students are, including how their demographics compare to other students in NYC, the educational challenges they face, and where they live. The bulk of the report reviews low-achieving students' most preferred schools and the ones to which they were ultimately assigned, assessing how these schools compare to those of their higher-achieving peers. The findings show that low-achieving students attended schools that were lower performing, on average, than those of all other students. This was driven by differences in students' initial choices: low-achieving students' first-choice schools were less selective, lower-performing, and more disadvantaged. Overall, lower-achieving and higher-achieving students were matched to their top choices at the same rate. Importantly, both low- and higher-achieving students appear to prefer schools that are close to home, suggesting that differences in students' choices likely reflect, at least in part, the fact that lower-achieving students are highly concentrated in poor neighborhoods, where options may be more limited.

In addition to archival analysis of ten years of documents and statistics, the study draws upon twenty-nine semi-structured interviews with key advocates. Major findings reveal how city-suburban magnet schools have been a two-edged blade for Hartford’s Latino residents, resulting in important tangible and symbolic gains for some, but diluting benefits that were originally slated for Hartford’s neighborhood youth.},

  abstract = {"The next step was mapping, which happened in partnership with CT Data Collaborative. The team requested maps from all 169 towns, a process that lasted roughly four months. “We had a huge spreadsheet with the data and a collection of GIS data,” explains Ilya Ilyankou, a member of the collaborative. “Our job was to marry those two pieces together.” Some maps turned over by town planners were PDFs or hand-drawn — meaning the team had to digitize them themselves, knitting them together with the surrounding zoning districts. There were other challenges in “putting the pieces together,” as the team thought of it. They had to map overlay zoning — essentially a special zoning district placed over the existing zoning. They also found that many towns had land owned by the state or federal government, out of the town’s jurisdiction. The team marked that distinctly in the map. Overall, the goal was to create a map that felt accessible. “We knew the message [of Desegregate CT],” Ilyankou says. “It was up to us to build the tool to echo that message.” The Zoning Atlas launched in January and was dubbed “likely to be one of the most important tools for planning our communities our state has ever seen” by Rebecca Augur, president of the Connecticut Chapter of the American Planning Association."},

The voice of Connecticut’s African Americans rings clear through topics such as the Black Governors of Connecticut, nationally prominent black abolitionists like the reverends Amos Beman and James Pennington, the African American community’s response to the Amistad trial, the letters of Joseph O. Cross of the 29th Regiment of Colored Volunteers in the Civil War, and the Civil Rights work of baseball great Jackie Robinson (a twenty-year resident of Stamford), to name a few. Insightful introductions to each section explore broader issues faced by the state’s African American residents as they struggled for full rights as citizens. This book represents the collaborative effort of Connecticut Explored and the Amistad Center for Art \& Culture, with support from the State Historic Preservation Office and Connecticut’s Freedom Trail. It will be a valuable guide for anyone interested in this fascinating area of Connecticut’s history.Contributors include Billie M.

The commission enacted the zoning regulations previously approved by a town meeting. In 1948, after the town had voted to adopt the provisions of the 1947 enabling act, amended regulations were passed by the commission and approved by a town meeting. Section 10 of the amended regulations provided, as did the original regulations, that the regulations could not be amended changed or repealed until after a public hearing by the commission and approval by a majority vote at a town meeting. A change of zone for the plaintiffs' properties was enacted by the commission in 1955 but failed of approval by the town meeting.

"Jeffrey Henig’s book, Spin Cycle: How Research is Used in Policy Debates: The Case of Charter Schools, investigates the causes of the politicization of charter school research. The impetus for his book is an article appearing on the front page, “above the fold,” of the New York Times, in August 2004. The article described a report released, as an exclusive to the Times, by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) on the performance of charter schools. The AFT report detailed National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) test results comparing charter schools to regular public schools obtained from the U.S. Department of Education’s website. The Times article began, “The first national comparison of test scores among children in charter schools and regular public schools shows charter school students often doing worse than comparable students in regular public schools” (Schemo, 2004, as quoted in Henig, pp. 1-2). The article went on, Henig says, to imply “that the Bush administration, which was a vocal and active proponent of charter schools, had tried to suppress the evidence” (p. 2). Its prominent publication set off a chain of subsequent events, beginning with a full-page advertisement in the following day’s Times, signed by well known researchers, criticizing the research methods used in the report and, by implication, the Times’ coverage of it. The politicized chain of events then continued with an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, the rushed release of additional charter schools research, and a general degradation of civility among some researchers and activists involved the issue. As one advocate commented, “all hell broke loose” (Petrilli, quoted in Henig, p. 3)"},

(I was a witness in the initial trial and learned a great deal about Hartford and the state’s schools and school policy and about the communities with the metro at the time). After a long wait, the Connecticut Supreme Court reviewed the massive record in the case and made some very important findings. The Court held that the state had an obligation to pursue integrated schools and that those rights extended beyond municipal boundaries. In fact, the state court found that a system of district boundaries that segregated students and made integration almost impossible were themselves in violation of the state constitution. But, it charged the legislature with coming up with a solution. What followed were modest initial steps and years of back and forth efforts to develop solutions that worked through choice process and to gain the resources to implement. The efforts have not eliminated segregation or ended racial achievement gaps but it is the only state in the Northeast that is going in a positive direction and it has created voluntary processes that have clearly reduced severe segregation in a time devoid of national leadership. This is a solid accomplishment that the state should be proud of and other states should look at as an example.},

  abstract = {The first major battle over school choice came out of struggles over equalizing and integrating schools in the civil rights era, when it became apparent that choice could be either a serious barrier or a significant tool for reaching these goals. The second large and continuing movement for choice was part of the very different anti-government, individualistic, market-based movement of a more conservative period in which many of the lessons of that earlier period were forgotten, though choice was once again presented as the answer to racial inequality. This book brings civil rights back into the center of the debate and tries to move from doctrine to empirical research in exploring the many forms of choice and their very different consequences for equity in U.S. schools. Leading researchers conclude that although helping minority children remains a central justification for choice proponents, ignoring the essential civil rights dimensions of choice plans risks compounding rather than remedying racial inequality.

Nearly fifteen years later, this book remains a groundbreaking study of a group still underrepresented in the academic and public spheres. The result of living for three years in “Groveland,” a black middle-class neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, Black Picket Fences explored both the advantages the black middle class has and the boundaries they still face. Despite arguments that race no longer matters, Pattillo showed a different reality, one where black and white middle classes remain separate and unequal.~Stark, moving, and still timely, the book is updated for this edition with a new epilogue by the author that details how the neighborhood and its residents fared in the recession of 2008, as well as new interviews with many of the same neighborhood residents featured in the original. Also~ included is a new foreword by acclaimed University of Pennsylvania sociologist Annette Lareau.},

Using qualitative interviews with seventy-seven poor and working-class Black parents in Chicago, this article asks: How well do the themes of empowerment, agency, and control characterize the experiences of low-income African American parents tasked with putting their children in schools? Also, what kind of political positions emerge from parents’ everyday experiences given the ubiquitous language of school choice? I find that in their own recounting parents focused on finding a quality school while experiencing numerous barriers to accessing such schools; parents expressed experiential knowledge of being chosen, rather than choosing; and parents highlighted the opacity, uncertainty, and burden of choice, even when they participated in it quite heartily. I argue that their stories convey limited and weak empowerment, limited individual agency, and no control. Their perspectives conjure policy frameworks and political ideologies that require a discussion of entitlements and provision, rather than choice.},

As such, there are several pieces in the National Highway System – the term used for the combination of Interstates highways and U.S. routes – that cut across existing grains within urban landscapes. As a result, some urban scholars have stated that the Federal-Aid Highway Act has been the most harmful federal policy aimed at American cities. The highway’s attack on urban areas was detrimental in two important manners. First, it allowed for middle-class whites to flee from declining urban cores to homogeneous suburban communities outside of the central city’s tax base. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, freeways became concrete barriers that divided cities, destroyed existing neighborhoods and brought tremendous amounts of auditory, visual and environmental pollution to urban communities.},

  abstract = {The past several decades have been accompanied by a growing concern regarding the viability of auto-centric planning as it relates to environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Research has shown that dense, multimodal urban development has many benefits over the sprawling land use patterns that are so common today. As there are few modern places that are free of automobile-oriented development, historic cities often act as great sources of this information. Unfortunately, it is difficult to fully explore and understand Pre-Automobile Era cities because of a lack of accessible data. Through GIS digitization of maps of Hartford, Connecticut around 1920, it was possible to quantify characteristics of an historic American city built for pedestrians and compare it to modern-day development patterns. Initial results show that the trolley system of 1920, while not significantly superior to the modern bus system, was effective in moving residents from their homes to the downtown commercial center and moving people throughout the Greater Hartford region. The 1920 system was also accompanied by more multimodal streets and residential land use development that employed a small-scale, uniform building pattern. This research is a starting point for developing a more advanced analysis of the significant changes to Hartford’s urban fabric as it has gone from transit-oriented to auto-oriented. It is believed that by using tangible data to describe the urban form of the American city before it was dominated by the automobile, important insights can be gained in the push for safer, more sustainable, and more vibrant places.},

  abstract = {In recent decades a growing number of middle-class parents have considered sending their children to—and often end up becoming active in—urban public schools. Their presence can bring long-needed material resources to such schools, but, as Linn Posey-Maddox shows in this study, it can also introduce new class and race tensions, and even exacerbate inequalities. Sensitively navigating the pros and cons of middle-class transformation, When Middle-Class Parents Choose Urban Schools asks whether it is possible for our urban public schools to have both financial security and equitable diversity. ~~~~~~~~~~~ Drawing on in-depth research at an urban elementary school, Posey-Maddox examines parents’ efforts to support the school through their outreach, marketing, and volunteerism. She shows that when middle-class parents engage in urban school communities, they can bring a host of positive benefits, including new educational opportunities and greater diversity. But their involvement can also unintentionally marginalize less-affluent parents and diminish low-income students’ access to the improving schools. In response, Posey-Maddox argues that school reform efforts, which usually equate improvement with rising test scores and increased enrollment, need to have more equity-focused policies in place to ensure that low-income families also benefit from—and participate in—school change.},

  abstract = {"This article examines two Arizona-based charter school organizations, well known for their high academic rankings locally and nationally. In response to President Obama's May 5th through May 11th 2013 “National Charter Schools Week” proclamation, and his call for the nation's support of highly performing charter schools, the author analyzes the schools' demographic profiles, using data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the Common Core of Data (CCD), and the Arizona Department of Education (ADE). The author also explores current public discourses surrounding the two charter school organizations. The findings are relevant and timely in light of Obama’s call to extend and replicate successful charter schools throughout the United States, because the results problematize the definition and nuances of charter school “success” by considering the study’s schools in relation to their underrepresentation of disadvantaged students. Based on evidence discovered in the study, the author provides relevant policy questions and suggestions for local, state, and federal education policymakers." “America's success in the 21st century depends on what we do today to reignite the true engine of our economic growth: a thriving middle class. Achieving that vision means making sure our education system provides ladders of opportunity for our sons and daughters. We need to equip all our students with the education and skills that put them on the path to good jobs and a bright future -- no matter where they live or what school they attend.” – Barack Obama (2013)},

  abstract = {Background \& Purpose: The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) recently released a summary of five CREDO studies of charter school outcomes produced between 2009 and 2013. We compared the WWC’s summary, which highlighted the statistical significance of the findings, to the effect sizes reported in the individual reports. We also addressed the findings reported in the original studies that were not summarized in the WWC reports. Research Design: Analytic essay highlighting the gaps between the findings reported in the summary WWC report, the individual WWC reports for each study, and the original CREDO studies. Findings: We argue that focusing on statistical significance is potentially misleading. The WCC summary invites the reader to conclude that charter schools had a greater effect on students’ achievement gains than traditional public schools. Comparing across the studies’ effect sizes suggests that the average effect of charter schools on students’ achievement gains is negligible. The WWC reports also do not address the considerable variation in achievement gains within and across subgroups of students and schools. Conclusion: Summaries generated from research studies should provide an accounting of findings that allows practitioners to assess their practical importance. When these and similar reports are hard to understand and misleading, they run the risk of eroding practitioners’ trust in research and increasing rather than bridging the gulf between research and practice.},

Explore this story map to learn why many of DC’s “historically black” neighborhoods were once exclusively white, and how the city’s racial geography has been shaped by segregation. As Mapping Segregation’s first installment, the story map focuses on legal challenges to covenants and where they took place. It also reveals why DC was central to the struggle to abolish restricted housing nationwide. This is the first project of its kind; racial covenants have never been comprehensively documented for any American city nor combined or exhibited with other data in this way. Organized by Prologue DC and GIS mapping specialist Brian Kraft of JMT Technology Group, it was launched in January 2014 and has been funded in part by Humanities DC.},

Though Governor Malloy’s “education reform legislation” was not passed until months after students had filled out bubble sheets to prove they were learning, that fact has not prevented some from attributing the gains to the so-called reform movement. In Hartford, gains did not occur across the board; in fact, the total percentage of third graders proficient in reading actually decreased slightly: in 2011, 51.5\% were proficient, but in 2012, the number dropped to 50\%},

  abstract = {Did American racism originate in the liberal North? An inquiry into the system of institutionalized racism created by Northern Jim Crow Jim Crow was not a regional sickness, it was a national cancer. Even at the high point of twentieth century liberalism in the North, Jim Crow racism hid in plain sight. Perpetuated by colorblind arguments about “cultures of poverty,” policies focused more on black criminality than black equality. Procedures that diverted resources in education, housing, and jobs away from poor black people turned ghettos and prisons into social pandemics. Americans in the North made this history. They tried to unmake it, too. Liberalism, rather than lighting the way to vanquish the darkness of the Jim Crow North gave racism new and complex places to hide. The twelve original essays in this anthology unveil Jim Crow’s many strange careers in the North. They accomplish two goals: first, they show how the Jim Crow North worked as a system to maintain social, economic, and political inequality in the nation’s most liberal places; and second, they chronicle how activists worked to undo the legal, economic, and social inequities born of Northern Jim Crow policies, practices, and ideas. The book ultimately dispels the myth that the South was the birthplace of American racism, and presents a compelling argument that American racism actually originated in the North.},

In 1947, the legislature amended those statutes, requiring commissions to hold public hearings on proposed zone changes and to submit them to the legislative body for approval if a majority of the people who attended the hearing opposed the changes. Avon immediately adopted this change, but a year later adopted a more restrictive regulation. It prohibited the commission from amending, changing, or repealing a regulation without the legislative body's approval. In 1951, the legislature repealed the statute conditionally requiring legislative body approval. But Avon kept its restrictive regulation. In 1955, the commission submitted a proposed zone change it had unanimously approved to the legislative body, which subsequently rejected it. The applicant appealed, claiming the regulation was not valid, and the Supreme Court agreed (Olson). The court cited an earlier decision in which it held the 1925 zoning statute left “no doubt that it was the intent of the General Assembly to vest in a zoning commission the sole authority to make, amend or repeal regulations; and for that purpose the zoning commission became the legislative agency of the municipality. To admit that a town meeting could amend or repeal regulations duly made by the commission would be to recognize in it a power directly at variance with the legislative intent” (State ex. rel. Bezzini v. Hines, 133 Conn. 592 (1947)).},

  abstract = {Since the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, researchers and policy makers have paid close attention to trends in school segregation. Here we review the evidence regarding trends and consequences of both racial and economic school segregation since Brown. The evidence suggests that the most significant declines in black-white school segregation occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s. There is disagreement about the direction of more recent trends in racial segregation, largely driven by how one defines and measures segregation. Depending on the definition used, segregation has either increased substantially or changed little, although there are important differences in the trends across regions, racial groups, and institutional levels. Limited evidence on school economic segregation makes documenting trends difficult, but students appear to be more segregated by income across schools and districts today than in 1990. We also discuss the role of desegregation litigation, demographic changes, and residential segregation in shaping trends in both racial and economic segregation. We develop a general conceptual model of how and why school segregation might affect students and review the relatively thin body of empirical evidence that explicitly assesses the consequences of school segregation. We conclude with a discussion of aspects of school segregation on which further research is needed.},

  abstract = {In this chapter I examine whether and how the relationship between family socioeconomic characteristics and academic achievement has changed during the last fifty years. In particular, I investigate the extent to which the rising income inequality of the last four decades has been paralleled by a similar increase in the income achievement gradient. As the income gap between high- and low-income families has widened, has the achievement gap between children in high- and low-income families also widened? The answer, in brief, is yes. The achievement gap between children from high- and low-income families is roughly 30 to 40 percent larger among children born in 2001 than among those born twenty-five years earlier. In fact, it appears that the income achievement gap has been growing for at least fifty years, though the data are less certain for cohorts of children born before 1970. In this chapter, I describe and discuss these trends in some detail. In addition to the key finding that the income achievement gap appears to have widened substantially, there are a number of other important findings. First, the income achievement gap (defined here as the average achievement difference between a child from a family at the 90th percentile of the family income distribution and a child from a family at the 10th percentile) is now nearly twice as large as the black-white achievement gap. Fifty years ago, in contrast, the black-white gap was one and a half to two times as large as the income gap. Second, as Greg Duncan and Katherine Magnuson note in chapter 3 of this volume, the income achievement gap is large when children enter kindergarten and does not appear to grow (or narrow) appreciably as children progress through school. Third, although rising income inequality may play a role in the growing income achievement gap, it does not appear to be the dominant factor. The gap appears to have grown at least partly because of an increase in the association between family income and children’s academic achievement for families above the median income level: a given difference in family incomes now corresponds to a 30 to 60 percent larger difference in achievement than it did for children born in the 1970s. Moreover, evidence from other studies suggests that this may be in part a result of increasing parental investment in children’s cognitive development. Finally, the growing income achievement gap does not appear to be a result of a growing achievement gap between children with highly and less-educated parents. Indeed, the relationship between parental education and children’s achievement has remained relatively stable during the last fifty years, whereas the relationship between income and achievement has grown sharply. Family income is now nearly as strong as parental education in predicting children’s achievement.},

  abstract = {Context: Despite the recent emphasis on public school choice, more than four-fifths of public school students still attend the traditional school to which they are assigned (NCES CCD, 2013), making attendance zone boundaries critical and fiercely contested determinants of educational opportunity. Historical and anecdotal evidence suggests that attendance zone boundaries are not “accidents of geography,” but have been “gerrymandered” into irregular shapes in ways that alter patterns of student attendance. However, no empirical evidence has directly examined the issue of attendance zone gerrymandering. Purpose of Study: Drawing on the literature on electoral gerrymandering, we outline a framework for conceptualizing and measuring educational gerrymandering. Using geospatial techniques, we then provide initial empirical evidence on the gerrymandering of school attendance zones and the variation in gerrymandering across geographic and demographic contexts. Research Design: We analyze the boundaries of a large national sample of 23,945 school attendance zones obtained from the School Attendance Boundary Information System (SABINS). For each attendance zone, we compute complementary measures assessing two dimensions of gerrymandering: (1) dispersion, or the elongation of the area of a boundary; and (2) indentation, or the irregularity of the perimeter of a boundary. Results: Overall, we find that attendance zones are highly gerrymandered—nearly as much as legislative districts—and are becoming more gerrymandered over time. Findings underscore the racial and, to a lesser extent, socioeconomic character of gerrymandering, which is particularly acute in Whiter and more affluent schools and in areas experiencing rapid racial change. Conclusions: The gerrymandering of school attendance zones has significant implications for students and schools. Gerrymandering alters patterns of attendance and, thereby, student access to educational opportunity and resources, by “zoning out” certain students living closer to schools while “zoning in” others living farther away. Gerrymandered boundaries also hold the potential to significantly alter the racial and ethnic composition of schools and may serve as a mechanism of segregation. In addition, gerrymandered attendance zones are inherently inefficient and may impose additional transportation costs on students and districts. We conclude with implications for state and federal policy.},

Since white, advantaged parents are more likely to get their children into the highest-status schools regardless of the school choice policy in place, we believed that more research was needed on how those parents interact with school choice policies and whether they would support changes to those policies that would lead to less segregation across schools. Our interviews with advantaged New York City parents suggest that many are bothered by the segregation but that they are concerned that their children gain access to the “best” (mostly white) schools. The contradictions inherent in their choices are reconcilable, we argue, by offering more diverse and undivided school options.},

  abstract = {The topic of low-income neighborhoods and the different approaches to community development dominate the national discussion on urban revitalization and poverty reduction. The debate is ongoing, regardless of whether economic development models serve the broader interests of the community or the narrow interests of proponents and benefactors. This study analyzes the impact of urban revitalization projects in the Frog Hollow neighborhood of Hartford, Connecticut, an impoverished but vibrant Latino enclave in the city. Frog Hollow underwent a highly publicized series of revitalization projects during the 2000s, where business owners, community organizations and local government were involved in both development and implementation. This study focuses on three areas: (a) identifying the history, goals, strategies, and tactics behind the community economic development model used in Frog Hollow; (b) examining the impact of these revitalization projects on the socioeconomic conditions of the neighborhood and its residents; and (c) determining how being a poor, Puerto Rican/Latino enclave impacted the design, process, and implementation of community development projects. By looking at archival and census data, and interviewing key stakeholders, this case study analyzes the impact of urban revitalization on a densely populated ethnic district and its residents, contributing to the body of social work literature on the best practices of community revitalization and development.},

While the Democratic and Republican chairmen of the time were entrenched in a debate over the state’s unequal political representation system, Bernstein dared to dream a little bigger. As a member of the Bloomfield Board of Education, Bernstein recognized that Connecticut was the only state that did not guarantee its citizens a constitutional right to an education. Bernstein thus decided to draft a new amendment to address this problem. After days of being ignored by his Democratic Party superiors and, finally, threatening to confront the media about his concerns, Bernstein’s request was met. Delegates at the 1965 Connecticut Constitutional Convention passed Bernstein’s amendment which guarantees free public education to every child. This set the stage for a series of prominent educational lawsuits, including Horton v. Meskill (1970), Sheff v. O’Neill (1989), and Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding (CCJEF) v.

  abstract = {In this groundbreaking history of the modern American metropolis, Richard Rothstein, a leading authority on housing policy, explodes the myth that America's cities came to be racially divided through de facto segregation--that is, through individual prejudices, income differences, or the actions of private institutions like banks and real estate agencies. Rather, The Color of Law incontrovertibly makes it clear that it was de jure segregation--the laws and policy decisions passed by local, state, and federal governments--that actually promoted the discriminatory patterns that continue to this day. Through extraordinary revelations and extensive research that Ta-Nehisi Coates has lauded as "brilliant" (The Atlantic), Rothstein comes to chronicle nothing less than an untold story that begins in the 1920s, showing how this process of de jure segregation began with explicit racial zoning, as millions of African Americans moved in a great historical migration from the South to the North. As Jane Jacobs established in her classic The Death and Life of Great American Cities, it was the deeply flawed urban planning of the 1950s that created many of the impoverished neighborhoods we know. Now, Rothstein expands our understanding of this history, showing how government policies led to the creation of officially segregated public housing and the demolition of previously integrated neighborhoods. While urban areas rapidly deteriorated, the great American suburbanization of the post-World War II years was spurred on by federal subsidies for builders on the condition that no homes be sold to African Americans. Finally, Rothstein shows how police and prosecutors brutally upheld these standards by supporting violent resistance to black families in white neighborhoods. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 prohibited future discrimination but did nothing to reverse residential patterns that had become deeply embedded. Yet recent outbursts of violence in cities like Baltimore, Ferguson, and Milwaukee show us precisely how the legacy of these earlier eras contributes to persistent racial unrest. "The American landscape will never look the same to readers of this important book," comments Sherrilyn A. Ifill. Indeed, Rothstein's invaluable examination demonstrates that only by relearning American urban history can we finally pave the way for the nation to remedy its unconstitutional past. -- Inside jacket flaps.},

Michael Brown’s death and the resulting protests and racial tension brought considerable attention to that town. Observers who had not been looking closely at our evolving demographic patterns were surprised to see ghetto conditions we had come to associate with inner cities now duplicated in a formerly white suburban community: racially segregated neighborhoods with high poverty and unemployment, poor student achievement in overwhelmingly black schools, oppressive policing, abandoned homes, and community powerlessness. Media accounts of how Ferguson became Ferguson have typically explained that when African Americans moved to this suburb (and others like it), “white flight” followed, abandoning the town to African Americans who were trying to escape poor schools in the city. The conventional explanation adds that African Americans moved to a few places like Ferguson, not the suburbs generally, because prejudiced real estate agents steered black homebuyers away from other white suburbs. And in any event, those other suburbs were able to preserve their almost entirely white, upper-middleclass environments by enacting zoning rules that required only expensive single family homes, the thinking goes. No doubt, private prejudice and suburbanites’ desire for homogenous affluent environments contributed to segregation in St. Louis and other metropolitan areas. But these explanations are too partial, and too conveniently excuse public policy from responsibility. A more powerful cause of metropolitan segregation in St. Louis and nationwide has been the explicit intents of federal, state, and local governments to create racially segregated metropolises.},

  abstract = {Creating the Suburban School Advantage explains how American suburban school districts gained a competitive edge over their urban counterparts. John L. Rury provides a national overview of the process, focusing on the period between 1950 and 1980, and presents a detailed study of metropolitan Kansas City, a region representative of trends elsewhere.While big-city districts once were widely seen as superior and attracted families seeking the best educational opportunities for their children, suburban school systems grew rapidly in the post–World War II era as middle-class and more affluent families moved to those communities. As Rury relates, at the same time, economically dislocated African Americans migrated from the South to center-city neighborhoods, testing the capacity of urban institutions. As demographic trends drove this urban-suburban divide, a suburban ethos of localism contributed to the socioeconomic exclusion that became a hallmark of outlying school systems. School districts located wholly or partly within the municipal boundaries of Kansas City, Missouri, make for revealing cases that illuminate our understanding of these national patterns.As Rury demonstrates, struggles to achieve greater educational equity and desegregation in urban centers contributed to so-called white flight and what Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan considered to be a crisis of urban education in 1965. Despite the often valiant efforts made to serve inner city children and bolster urban school districts, this exodus, Rury cogently argues, created a new metropolitan educational hierarchy—a mirror image of the urban-centric model that had prevailed before World War II. The stubborn perception that suburban schools are superior, based on test scores and budgets, has persisted into the twenty-first century and instantiates today's metropolitan landscape of social, economic, and educational inequality.},

It concerns the control of resources, defined in any number of ways, that allow certain groups to exclude others from access to said resources or benefits accruing to them. While Tilly used the term in distinction to other forms of social control and manipulation, such as exploitation, in recent years other scholars have viewed opportunity hoarding as a mechanism or means of exploitation. With its growing use, opportunity hoarding has been employed in a range of studies and likely will find even wider use in years to come. In the meantime, it is likely that its meaning and significance will continue to change as well. (publisher)},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}This study examines urban/suburban differences in educational outcomes in light of Tilly’s conception of “opportunity hoarding.” Data from the U.S. Census reveal the changing circumstances of 17-year-olds in central city and suburban settings across the post–World War II period. Focusing on the metropolitan Northeast and Eastern Midwest, we consider a range of factors associated with differences in educational attainment. Using a multilevel analytic strategy, we find evidence that clear distinctions emerged in this period, marking the educational status of youth in central city and suburban settings. While there were signs of urban/suburban inequality in certain metropolitan contexts and for specific types of suburbs in 1940, 40 years later the urban-suburban divide was clearly evident across all metropolitan settings. A wide range of factors became associated with this form of spatial differentiation in school experiences during the postwar era, suggesting that a prolonged process of systematic exclusion characterized this dimension of metropolitan development. We close with a brief discussion of policy implications for addressing school-related factors that may contribute to these differences.},

Just when I thought I had located an important collection of organizational materials ina  former resident's basement, I found out tha the new owners had thrown them away as trash." p27 all names of local respondents changed Local level: Model A: Success Indianapolis (Butler-Tarkington Neighborhood Assoc) Rochester (19th Ward Community Assoc) Milwaukee (Sherman Park Community Association) Model B: Failure  [*this chapter was scanned and saved as PDF*] Hartford (Blue Hills Civic Association) author's acknowledgements: Bob and Martha Bellieveau, Bill Brayfield, Mary Collier, Jesse Collins, Ralph Dumas, Boyd Hinds (deceased), Linda Kelly, Howard Klebenoff, Jim Mason, Jim Miller, Dottie Payne, Gerri Porter, Bob Sadler, Rhea and Phil Starr, Geri Sullivan, Patricia Sweet, Allen Taylor, Margaret and Bill Worthington, CHS, HCourant, HPL, HPS author received phone number of BHCA from National Neighbors office, but at predom black meeting at St Justin's church in 1984, concluded that "This group was definitely not the BHCA, though it had the same initials and worked in the same neighborhood. the BHCA I knew about was surely dead, and Blue Hills was no longer an integrated comunity." p161 Hartford city historical background; see Pawlowski 1973;  on 1950s urban renewal that cleared 190 acres near downtown, dislocating more than 1200 households and 750 businesses; cites Hartford City Planning Dept 1983 report:  "By the end of that decade [1950s] Hartford lost more than 15,000 residents and numerous businesses...The combination of better highway systems, suburban housing opportunity and urban blight resulted in an exodus of moderate and upper income residents and the further concentration of urban poor" (p. 3 in original; p164 here) reviews HPS school deseg efforts (draws from Champ 1975)draws on words of former board member to interpret BHCA in three phases: (1) "to keep the blacks out" (1962-1965, 1965-1968); (2) "to achieve integration" (1969-1975); (3) "to have neighborhood stabilization -- meaning economic upkeep" (1976-1980), p188 sources for BCHA organizational history:  Blue Hills News paper, BHCA minutes, and Vincent Bolduc 1976 thesis a key dividing issue within the organization was the focus of its housing cmte (1965-69) attempted to counter panic selling by setting up own signs ("This Home NOT for Sale") also, formed real estate listing service in 1968 to counter block-busting realtors; distributed brochures to attract prospective buyers to Blue Hills, followed up with personal contacts and tours, p 194 real estate service transferred in 1969 from volunteers into a separate a separate entity -- Blue Hills Housing Services Corporation -- which faced internal dissent and dissolved in 1972 author's analysis: Blue Hills became 43\% black, up from 10\% a decade earlier; "the earliest statement about the new real estate service recognizes the difficulty of maintaining integration, and the fragility of stabilization, but it does not come to grips with the need for a specific strategy to achieve it. The statement refers to whites and blacks, but does not deal with racial groups as part of a planned strategy: 'Many...people have been discouraged from buying here by real estate agents who warned prospective white families that this area will be the nexxt ghetto. Many Negro families ahve contacted us to inquire whethr or not the area is in fact becomgin a ghetto and to inquire how the area would react to their living here' (News, May 1968)" p194-95 "The same inability to deal with a specific strategy for integration maintenance can be seen in a housing policy statement developed in November 1969"; BHCA Nov 1969 housing doc stresses "open occupancy" at first, then specific tactic for maintaining "the integrated quality of life in the neighborhood. This means that e will work to interest white families in living in the area...It is easy to misinterpret such a statement to say that it is opposed to open housing. In fact, the statement is an attempt to counteract the well-documented flight of white families out of the city, especially from area that are integrated. If we want to maintain an open neighborhood, it must be open to all in fact, not just in theory. Affirmative action is required to attrac and retain white families to the area generally, whiel at the same time we support open housing in every individual sale or rental." p195 author's analysis: document did not emphasize neighborhood quality issues or need for regional open housing for blacks; "Instead, the Blue Hills area continued to be the only hospitable neighborhood in the city for upwardly mobilie blacks, and their pent-up demand for housing resulted in continuing racial concentration inthe Blue Hills neighborhood." p196 controversy in BH Housing Services Corp over white-priority focus; see Bolduc 1976 thesis; HT 19 June 1971 editorial; sold 23 homes to whites form suburban areas; when "outspoken" BHCA members asked for "a clarificaiton of the corporation's racial policy" and questioned whether white preferences was racist, shareholders withdrew support and corporation dissolved p197 BHCA housing cmte continued monitoring and legal actions against real estate activities:  \#1) block-busting complaint filed with HUD on 11 Nov 1971, then ref to CT Comm on Human Rights and Opportunities, then filed in Federal district court; "When the agent gave up his real estate license, the court declared the case moot. It was the first use of fair housing law in the State of CT (letter from attorney to HUD, 5 June 1972)" \#2) racial-steering suit brought by Education/Instruccion (EI) "still another splinter group formed in 1971 by formerly active BHCA members and residents. EI was a general civil rights group that conducted educational research"p 197; housing test cases; lawsuit filed (with BHCA as one of several plaintiffs) in 1973-74 against 8 real estate firms; charges filed with US Dept of Justice 1974; investigated by FBI; denied by realtors (HC 21 Feb 1974); "A consent decree was issued in 1975, which required the companies to engage in fair housing practices and inform their staffs of provisioins of fair housing law. No admission of guilt was needed for the decree by Dept of Justice." p198 "Bob Harris, the former director of EI, a former BHCA member and Blue Hills resident and in 1984 one of the few remaining whites, said the Hartford newspapers woudl not print the story when first infomred of the findings, becuase 'they had so much money in real estate advertising' it would be bad for business. Finally, he said: 'We ended up going to Associated Press and it went out through the AP wires and came back in with theAP heading and was printed in both papers the same morning to protect them. That's how sad the situation had become'. He also complained that the State Human Rights Commission, formed to receive and act on discrimination complaints, was ineffective" p198 [backed up 18 months] BHCA housing cmte stopped functions 1972 "after several former BHCA leaders formed Urban Edge as a nonprofit fair housing real estate company p198 BHCA and Education "Even more vital and important than the early housing commitee was BHCA's education committee"; focus on school quality, but dwindled after 1973; "By this time the Blue Hills shcools were almost totally black" p198 "The BHCA's overrriding concern with education and the public schools was linked to the association's goal of preservation of a high-quality racially integrated neighborhood. Since the schools were such a vitally important neighborhood facility, association leaders belived it essential to have high-quality education in its neighborhood schools. the earliest reputation of BHCA was as a school-oriented organization -- "just a big PTA" -- as minutes of a 1969 board meeting reveal (Bolduc 1976: 137)" p199 author's analysis: "Prevention of impaction [85\% black in 1980] might have occurred in 1971 if the housing corporation had been encouraged to continue its policy of affirmative marketing... What might have succeeded in 1971 was a well-coordinated effort to recruit whites to the Blue Hills neighborhood at the same time that blacks were given expanded housing choices elsewhere. This could have been done in conjunction with the CT Housing investment Fund, which was heavily funded to assist blacks in moving to the suburbs. Unfortunately, CHIF also had internal problems and coflicts, andeventually turned its focus to rental counseling,k energy conservation, and the rehabilitation of existing units. Though its active couseling and mortgage assitance efforts helped over 1,900 minority families move to the suburbs throughout the state of CT, this died not help the Blue Hills area." p203 "But there was no ongoing fair housing problem of combating racial discrimiation in the housing market. The two legal suits filed in the early 1970s were a mere ripple in the tide of housing discrimination" p204 author cites four external forces that acted against BHCA neighborhood organization (p. 204): 1) urban renewal and land clearance in downtown Hartford that displaced thousands of minorities 2) racial discrimination in housing and mortgage markets that resulted in Northend racial concentration 3) public housing location --"Two massive public housing projects bordered the Blue Hills area, and their children were included in the Blue Hills neighborhood schools." 4) school racial imbalance -- "city efforts at desegregation occurring too late and too little to avert racial impaction of the Blue Hills schools" Why did BHCA decline? "One logical explanation for this might be that hte neighborhood became so overwhelmingly black, the original goal was then impossible to attain, and so there was no cause left to work for. but that is too simple. If we lok at other neighborhood stabilization organization we find that even when the neighborhood became predominantly black, the organization continued with a secondary goal of neighorhood maintenance and improvement -- a perfectly respectable second aim for a neighborhood group. Why didn't BHCA do this?  One difference between BHCA an the orther movement orgs studied is that this was the only organization that did not begin with the stated goal of integration maintenance. by the time new leaders and members openly acclaimed that goal in 1965, the neighborhood was already almost half-black, and the schools there were predominantly black." p209  [*author would be more direct if she stated that BHCA's original purpose was to prevent blacks from moving into neighborhood, as she quoted Bob Harris earlier*]  "Permost most important as a reason for burnout was the bitter internal conflict over affirmative marketing tactics, which further weakened the organization and caused the spin-offs of two other organizations." p210 Bob Harris criticizes Project Concern for drawing "highest quality black kids" away from neighborhood schools, p211 An older white couple, still iving in Blue Hills, on Weaver HS:  "I think that more recently people moved [away] because of the schools. The high school was once awfully good and it was predominantly white when it was built. After we moved here, white attendance just slid off the map... Very bad -- for white children" p212 also, HPS board did not adopt 1965 Harvard plan due to state funding concerns; HPS board "spent the next ten yeras implementing piecemeal segments of the plan, avoiding others, and circumventing still others" [cites Champ 1975, Brayfield 1975] p212 BHCA acronym taken over by Blue Hills Citizen Action, a group with paid organizers, not neighborhood volunteers now Blue Hills is stablizing low-middle-class black community, one of most influential political communities in the city, p213 author's final postscript notes that BHCA has been revived, and she is sending materials to new director [**remember that most names are pseudonyms*] Still looking for these sources: [not in WorldCat; trying to contact Saltman, currrent BHCA]: Thomas Champ, "Compromised Efforts at Desegregation."

The covenanted properties formed an invisible barrier to less densely populated areas sought after by white residents and around predominantly white neighborhoods throughout the city.

  abstract = {"Most parents want to raise their children in neighborhoods with good schools, safe streets, and neighbors who support their efforts to raise healthy, happy, and successful families.  Their hopes are well-placed because a growing body of evidence supports two conclusions about how neighborhoods affect children’s well-being. First, high-poverty neighborhoods, which are often violent, stressful, and environmentally hazardous, can impair children’s cognitive development, school performance, mental health, and long-term physical health.  Second, poor children who live in low-poverty neighborhoods and consistently attend high-quality schools — where more students come from middle- or high-income families and do well academically, parents are more involved, teachers are likely to be more skilled, staff morale is higher, and student turnover is low — perform significantly better academically than those who do not. Nearly 4 million children live in families that receive federal rental assistance.  This assistance not only helps these families to afford decent, stable housing and make ends meet, but it also has the potential to enable their children to grow up in better neighborhoods and thereby enhance their chances of long-term health and success.  Historically, however, federal rental assistance programs have fallen short in helping families live in neighborhoods that provide these opportunities. Over several decades, policymakers have adopted measures to reduce the extent to which low-income families receiving federal rental assistance are concentrated in distressed neighborhoods and, instead, to improve these families’ access to safe neighborhoods with good schools, more opportunities for recreation and enrichment, and better access to jobs.  To do so, policymakers have relied increasingly on housing vouchers (rather than housing projects) so that families may choose where to live rather than be limited to government-funded projects that often are situated in very poor, segregated neighborhoods. Despite these efforts, in 2010 only 15 percent of the children in families that received rent subsidies through the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) three major rental assistance programs — the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, public housing, and Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (as described in Box 1) — lived in low-poverty neighborhoods, where fewer than 10 percent of the residents had incomes below the poverty line.  A greater share of such children (18 percent) lived in extreme-poverty neighborhoods, where at least 40 percent of the residents are poor.[1]    The HCV program has performed much better than HUD’s project-based rental assistance programs in enabling more low-income families with children — and particularly more African American and Latino families — to live in lower-poverty neighborhoods.  (Only a small share of public housing or privately owned units with project-based rental assistance for families with children are in low-poverty neighborhoods.)  Having a housing voucher also substantially reduces the likelihood of living in an extreme-poverty neighborhood, compared with similar families with children that either receive project-based rental assistance or don’t receive housing assistance at all.

Three of the best examples? Bridgeport, Hartford and New Haven. "I think that people are very much aware of the problem that where you live has a disproportionate impact on what school you go to," said Jonathan Rothwell, senior research analyst at the Washington, D.C.-based Brookings Institution and the author of the report. "It's just very expensive to live near a high-scoring school in many parts of the country." What's less understood, he said, is how local governments can work to make it even costlier. "States like Connecticut and New Jersey and Massachusetts and New York are some of the states that are most notorious in terms of having suburban governments that aggressively limit the supply of affordable housing."},

In the process of convincing the suburban towns to participate in a cooperative education program, the project leaders were forced to focus carefully on the desired results of busing urban children to the suburbs. Extensive records of the academic and social development of 260 children bused to 5 suburban towns were kept between 1966-1968, and compared to control groups of children remaining in the Hartford ghettos. The results of the testing and other data persuaded ten other towns and white middle class areas of Hartford City itself to participate in the project and accept target area children. (Author/DM)},

Bradley. In Boston, Detroit, and Philadelphia, segregationist urbanites, when faced with a legal challenge either created or made possible by black civil rights advocates, reversed course and trumpeted the advantages of metropolitan desegregation. These tactical metropolitanists recognized that a larger desegregation area reaching into the predominantly white suburbs would mean that white children would continue attending majority-white schools and they understood that stoking suburban opposition to desegregation could defeat integrationist legislation. Despite their segregationist motives, tactical metropolitanists offered a potentially productive solution capable of mitigating white flight, providing lasting integration, and aligning with the efforts of integrationist civil rights advocates in court. Uncovering tactical metropolitanism complicates our understandings of urban segregation and the sources of metropolitan reform. It suggests the need for a metropolitan history of civil rights that centers the importance of municipal boundaries in perpetuating inequality.},

  abstract = {summary: "Education has witnessed a broad movement to reduce the central role of school districts in the administration of schools by providing individual schools with greater independence in making educational decisions.  In noted cases, school districts have shifted responsibilities for budgetary allocation, choice of personnel, instructional strategies, curriculum, accountability, and professional development to school sites from central headquarters.  In other cases, they have converted schools from district-management to charter schools and schools that are contracted out to for-profit educational management organizations, universities, and other institutional sponsors.  In some school districts, such as New Orleans, there is an initiative to establish choice districts in which the goal is to minimize or even eliminate the district role and let schools compete for students in an educational marketplace. This paper examines the dynamics of two cases that have moved in this direction.  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada was one of the earliest of the larger school districts (76,000 students) to decentralize its operations some 30 years ago.  This substantial experience allows an inquiry into which functions have been successfully handled by schools and which have remained the responsibility of the school district, in some cases having been transformed by the district to accommodate school autonomy.  In the second case a group of six charter schools in Florida has been developed into a charter "district" under the official aegis of a County School District. Perhaps, surprisingly, many of the traditional roles of the sponsoring school districts have been retained and even strengthened to support the shift of major educational decisions to individual school sites."},

  abstract = {Inclusionary zoning (IZ) has become an increasingly popular tool for providing affordable housing in an economically integrative manner. IZ policies typically require developers to set aside a proportion of units in market-rate residential developments to be made affordable for lower-income households in exchange for development rights or zoning variances. These policies are considered "inclusionary" because they are intended to allow lower- and moderate-income households to buy or rent property in middle- and upper-income communities. This report examines 11 IZ programs across the United States to determine the extent to which the policies serve lower-income families and provide IZ recipients with access to low-poverty neighborhoods and residentially assign them to high-performing schools, thereby promoting the academic achievement and educational attainment of their children. It also considers ways in which IZ policies vary and how different design features might affect the success of the programs in promoting affordable housing and social inclusion for IZ recipients. Finally, it identifies key program-design aspects that shape the potential to meet the goals of providing affordable housing to low-income households and promoting social inclusion for IZ recipients.},

Opportunity and achievement, while inextricably connected, are very different goals. Every American will not go to college, but every American should be given a fair chance to be prepared for college. In communities across the U.S., children lack the crucial resources and opportunities, inside and outside of schools that they need if they are to reach their potential.  Closing the Opportunity Gap offers accessible, research-based essays written by top experts who highlight the discrepancies that exist in our public schools, focusing on how policy decisions and life circumstances conspire to create the "opportunity gap" that leads inexorably to stark achievement gaps. They also describe sensible policies grounded in evidence that can restore and enhance opportunities. Moving beyond conventional academic discourse, Closing the Opportunity Gap will spark vital new conversations about what schools, parents, educators, and policymakers can and should do to give all children a fair chance to thrive.},

  abstract = {Excerpts on Hartford or Connecticut:  "With the establishment of new industries to meet the needs of the war, the erection of munitions plants for the manufacture of war materials and the enlargement of already existing industries to meet the abnormally large demand for materials here and in Europe, there came a shifting in the existing labor supply in the North. There was a rush to the higher paid positions in the munitions plants. This, together with the advancement of the white men to higher positions nearly depleted the ranks of common labor. The companies employing foreign labor for railroad construction work, and in the steel mills of Pennsylvania, the tobacco fields of Connecticut, the packing houses, foundries and automobile plants of the Northwest, found it imperative to seek for labor in home fields. The Department of Labor, in the effort to relieve this shortage, through its employment service, at first assisted the migration northward. It later withdrew its assistance when its attention was called to the growing magnitude of the movement and its possible effect on the South. Deserted by the Department of Labor, certain northern employers undertook to translate their desire into action in 1915, when the anxieties of the New England tobacco planters were felt in the New York labor market. These planters at first rushed to New York and promiscuously gathered up 200 girls of the worst type, who straightway proceeded to demoralize Hartford. The blunder was speedily detected and the employers came back to New York, seeking some agency which might assist them in the solution of their problem. Importuned for help, the National League on Urban Conditions among Negroes supplied these planters with respectable southern blacks who met this unusual demand for labor in Connecticut. Later, moreover, it appeared that on the threshold of an unusually promising year the Poles, Lithuanians and Czechs, formerly employed in the fields, were dwindling in number and there was not at hand the usual supply from which their workers were recruited. A large number of these foreigners had been called back to their fatherland to engage in the World War. In January of 1916, therefore, the tobacco growers of Connecticut met in conference to give this question serious consideration. Mr. Floyd, the Manager of the Continental Tobacco Corporation, offered a solution for this difficult problem through the further importation of negro labor. The response to this suggestion was not immediate, because New England had never had large experience with the negro labor. An intense interest in the experiment, however, was aroused through a number of men with connections in the South. It was decided that the National League on Urban Conditions among Negroes, with headquarters in New York City, should further assist in securing laborers. Because of the seasonal character of the work, an effort was made to get students from the southern schools by advancing transportation. The "New York News," a negro weekly, says of this conference: '...Thus was born, right in the heart of Yankee Land, the first significant move to supplant foreign labor with native labor, a step which has resulted in one of the biggest upheavals in the North incident to the European war, which has already been a boon to the colored American, improving his economic status and putting thousands of dollars into his pockets.' .....The North may well be divided according to the two main lines followed by the migrants in leaving the South. The South and middle Atlantic States sent the majority of their migrants directly up the Atlantic coast while the south central States fed the Northwest. There is of course, no hard line of separation for these two streams. Laborers were sought in fields most accessible to the centers of industry, but individual choice as displayed in the extent of voluntary migration carried them everywhere. The New England States, which were probably the first to attract this labor, were Connecticut and Massachusetts. The tobacco fields of Connecticut with Hartford as a center received the first negro laborers as mentioned above. Before a year had passed there were over 3,000 southern Negroes in the city of Hartford. ...The eastern cities which made efforts through various means to augment their labor supply were Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Newark, New York City and Hartford. It is manifestly impossible to get reliable figures on the volume of increase in the negro population of any of these cities. All that is available is in the form of estimates which can not be too confidently relied upon. Estimates based on the average number of arrivals from the South per day, the increase in the school population and the opinions of social agencies which have engaged themselves in adjusting to their new homes appear to agree in the main." "Hartford was one of the industrial centers to which large numbers of the migrating Negroes went. The housing problem became acute and the chief efforts of those endeavoring to better the conditions of migrants was along this line. Religious, civic and commercial bodies gave attention to the amelioration of this problem. The problem of housing Negroes who were coming in greater numbers each year to Hartford was taken up briefly by speakers at the 128th annual meeting of the [end page 141] Hartford Baptist Association at the Shiloh Baptist Church. It was decided to bring the housing problem before the attention of the Chamber of Commerce, which, it was said, some time before had appointed a committee to investigate it. Negroes complained that they were obliged to pay higher rent than white folks and that they were obliged by landlords to live together in cramped quarters that were, by reason of the crowding, unsanitary. They said also that the living of several families almost as one family leads to a breaking down of the moral and religious ideals. Conditions in Hartford resulting from the bringing of more than 2,500 Negroes from the South were discussed at the fall meeting of the Confidential Exchange with a view to preparing for these new arrivals. At the June, 1917, meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, a committee was appointed from that body to investigate housing conditions and to cooperate with other agencies in improving them. The committee met frequently through the summer with the housing committee of the Civic Club, in an endeavor to ascertain the facts bearing upon the present situation. It had before it leading colored citizens, ministers, business men and industrial workers, some of whom have lived here for years and others who have recently arrived from the South. It was discovered that there was, at that time, plenty of work and at good wages, but the universal complaint was the lack of homes suitable for proper living and the extortionate prices asked for rents. Negroes in Hartford were suffering from the cupidity of landlords. They were obliged to live in poor tenements and under unhealthful conditions because accommodations of another class were withheld from them. For such inferior accommodations they were charged outrageous rents, because selfish property owners knowing that Negroes must live charged all the traffic would bear. Partial relief was obtained from the immediate need by the purchase of buildings already erected, and homes for them were later built. It appeared that for the first time in many years Hartford had a race problem on its hands." [end p 142] Bibliography lists: Hartford (Conn.)

  abstract = {Background/Context: At the close of the first decade of the 21st century, the intersection of race, geography and opportunity is increasingly referred to as spatial racism. School quality and resources, municipal services, employment opportunities, accessibility of transportation, exposure to pollution, and tax rates all vary dramatically across a network of invisible boundary lines that carve up U.S. metro areas into racially and socioeconomically distinctive spaces. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study:This analysis explores how district boundary lines and school desegregation policy have impacted metropolitan school and housing integration levels over the past two decades. Setting: The study focuses specifically on the South, where the most comprehensive desegregation strategies were pursued. Based on varying experiences with city-suburban school district mergers, four metros—Richmond, Virginia; Charlotte-Mecklenburg County, North Carolina; Louisville-Jefferson County, Kentucky; and Chattanooga-Hamilton County, Tennessee—were identified for study between the years 1990 and 2010. This time period encompassed a rising trend of unitary status for school districts, the serious resegregation of students, and growing demographic complexity across the country. Research Design: This is a quantitative analysis of school and housing segregation trends that relies upon Geographic Information Systems (GIS) maps to depict spatial patterns of isolation. School enrollment and segregation trends are derived from the National Center for Educational Statistics’ Common Core of Data. Housing patterns describing the distribution and segregation of persons by race and poverty status are explored using block group-level information from the U.S. Census Bureau’s decennial census. Segregation is measured using the Index of Dissimilarity (D). Findings/Results: Efforts to overcome the divisive nature of district boundary lines, in conjunction with comprehensive school desegregation policy, were related to unambiguous progress in combating both school and housing segregation. This central finding suggests that, in some ways, school policy can become housing policy. Conclusions/Recommendations: How we provide equal educational opportunity to an increasingly diverse population of students is one of the principal concerns facing the country today. As a nation, however, we are currently allowing a labyrinthine system of school-district boundary lines to dictate the geographic distribution of learning opportunities. This study provides concrete examples of metros implementing a more regional approach to educational equity. It recommends that other metro area consider taking similar steps to subvert the segregating power of school-district boundaries.

  abstract = {On August 5, 2013, roughly 150,000 students began their first day of class in Tennessee’s recently merged Memphis City and Shelby County school system. This August, a subset of students will bypass the consolidated district and enroll in one of the six new suburban school systems created in the aftermath of the merger. This paper explores what happened in the intervening year—in addition to how the initial merger came about—as a means of understanding the role school district boundary lines play in structuring educational inequality. District boundaries help give shape to widespread patterns of school segregation; indeed most segregation today is between districts (Clotfelter, 2004; Reardon \& Yun, 2005). Most metropolitan areas are characterized by multiple school systems that differ widely in their racial and socioeconomic makeup, as well as their students’ access to educational resources. Political boundaries separating school districts communicate crucial information to families and stakeholders about the related domains of school quality, property taxes and housing prices (Holme \& Finnigan, 2013; Rothwell, 2012; Ryan, 2010). As a result, the decision to either define school communities broadly or narrowly has extremely important implications for the distribution of equal educational opportunities. This analysis grows out of a larger, mixed methods case study of consolidation and fragmentation in the Memphis metro. Relying on approximately 20 semi-structured qualitative interviews with education stakeholders in the area, including members of the Shelby County Transition Planning Commission and Shelby County Schools Board of Education, along with superintendents, attorneys, central office personnel, civil rights activists, local policymakers, representatives of parents’ groups, and community organizations, we examine the political process behind the city-suburban merger, subsequent decisions about student assignment and resource distribution and the motivation for the swift creation of six breakaway districts on the fringe of the metro area. All interviews are audio recorded and transcribed directly after they occur. We utilize NVivo to code our interview data and other documents collected using codes derived from the literature on school district consolidation, fragmentation, segregation, and political processes, as well as additional codes that emerge from the data. Findings are checked and re-checked utilizing member checking with participants and our research team to ensure that interpretations of data are consistent with the data and that the conclusions are authentic (Miles \& Huberman, 1994). This iterative process of data analysis allows us to engage in a reflexive process that is inductive and open-ended (Miles \& Huberman, 1994).  Unpacking the politics surrounding the merger and fragmentation of districts in the Memphis area is critical to advancing our understanding of precisely how decisions about school-related boundary lines are made. In a time of rising inequality and rapid racial diversification, providing all students with equal educational opportunities is increasingly urgent. This study of the political process and early impact of a recent, wide-scale district consolidation, along with the subsequent fragmentation of several outlying suburban communities, will inform education policymakers and practitioners in Memphis and elsewhere.},

Beginning with height regulations in Washington, D.C., in 1899, efforts to control the type and intensity of land use spread to many cities. In 1908, Los Angeles adopted the nation's first citywide "use" zoning ordinance to protect its expanding residential areas from industrial nuisances. Over the next two decades, state legislatures nationwide granted to cities the power "to regulate the height, area, location, and use of buildings in any designated part or parts of their corporation limits." The U.S. Supreme Court's sanction of this exercise of a city's police power over land use came first in Hadacheck v. Sebastian (1915), which involved the Los Angeles ordinance, and culminated in the definitive Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Corporation case in 1926 (see planning- related documents, Part 5A)},

The disparate takes from the two coasts in less than a year frames the problems for folks who make it their business to put a shine on Hartford's reputation. They confront two contrasting perceptions -- the idea that Hartford is so disproportionately saddled with poor people and social ills that it is unsalvageable vs. the view that this multicultural city, with its first Latino mayor and more than a billion dollars in planned development, is poised for a resurgence. I'm in the camp that believes the latter. "This was a city with a riches-to-rags past," says Times reporter David Lamb, who wrote the article. "But I was impressed that the city and a lot of those neighborhoods are owning up to what's gone wrong and making serious attempts to bring Hartford back. I had a friend in Hartford who said he thought I was pretty kind to Hartford, but I was certainly impressed with a lot of the things I saw going on there."},

  abstract = {Book abstract: Since the early 1990s when the nation's first charter school was opened in Minneapolis, the scope and availability of school-based options to parents has steadily expanded. No longer can public education be characterized as a monopoly. Sponsored by the National Center on School Choice (NCSC), this handbook makes readily available the most rigorous and policy-relevant research on K-12 school choice. Coverage includes charters, vouchers, home schooling, magnet schools, cyber schools, and other forms of choice, with the ultimate goal of defining the current state of this evolving field of research, policy, and practice. Key Features include:Comprehensive – this is the first book to provide a comprehensive review of what is known about the major forms of school choice from multiple perspectives: historical, political, economic, legal, methodological, and international. It also includes work on the governance, structure, process, effectiveness, and costs of school choice.Readable – the editors and authors have taken care to translate rigorous research findings into comprehensible prose accessible to a broad range of readers.International – in addition to thorough coverage of domestic research, the volume also draws on international and comparative studies of choice in foreign countries. Expertise – the National Center on School Choice (NCSC) is a consortium that is headquartered at Vanderbilt University and includes the following partners: Brookings Institution, Brown University, Harvard University, National Bureau of Economic Research, Northwest Evaluation Association, and Stanford University. This book is suitable for researchers, faculty and graduate students in education policy studies, politics of education, and social foundations of education. It should also be of interest to inservice administrators and policy makers.},

The district also is holding its first citywide Kindergarten Fair to help parents navigate the enrollment process. In addition to distributing a magnet school guide, the district will provide a complete guide of all New Haven schools this year. “Parents have long been asking for a simplified process that clearly lays out kindergarten choices and offers a fair path to school enrollment. These changes will help strengthen the overall experience for families as they begin their journey with New Haven Public Schools.

  abstract = {This is a study of desegregation and quality education, issues of increasing concern in Hartford, Connecticut. The population of the city has become increasingly minority (non-white and Hispanic), while the surrounding towns, for the most part, have significantly smaller minority enrollments. Therefore, neither the central city, nor the majority of its suburbs, is able to offer its schoolchildren the benefit of a quality, integrated education within its own boundaries.\^ Policy science reinforces conventional wisdom that studying the experiences of others will more certainly assure success in making important choices. As Hartford appears likely to engage in some desegregation efforts, whether by court order, instigation by the governor, and/or legislative action, there is benefit to studying other cities which share similarities of population and circumstances and which have experienced desegregation efforts.\^ The purpose of this study is to create a projective analysis of desegregation for the City of Hartford by examining through case studies four communities found sufficiently similar to Hartford to justify comparison. These communities are: Dayton, Ohio; Rochester, New York; Trenton, New Jersey; and Wilmington, Delaware.\^ A review of the literature includes a compendium of the legal cases related to school desegregation beginning with Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 and continuing to the present. Descriptions and analysis of the writings on school desegregation include the diverse methods in favor at various times such as voluntary and mandatory busing, schools of choice and controlled choice, magnet schools, and metropolitan regionalization.\^ The study finds that rapidly shifting populations make projections somewhat risky. However, respecting certain widely held concerns will make successful desegregation more likely. Parents seek a safe environment for their children and want to have an influence in where those children are educated. Committed and charismatic leadership, extensive community participation, the availability of enhanced educational components to guarantee a high quality of education, cooperative city-state relations, and a metropolitan region large enough to discourage white flight are qualities likely to encourage positive results.},

  abstract = {This article explores the passage and failure of the 1973 Illinois Resource Equalizer formula which was designed to reduce disparities in school finance by breaking the connection between local wealth and school revenue. It argues that two sets of goals drove passage of the new law—equity and local property tax relief—and they came into conflict during implementation, with the latter winning out over the former. It argues that to understand both the passage and failure of the law requires looking deeply at the politics, policies, and practices of taxation, especially the methods of assessing property and levying taxes, where officials made decisions about how to apportion burden and benefits. The Illinois Resource Equalizer story highlights the political and policy choices that structure inequality through school finance at a moment when it was quietly defended and deepened. -- school finance reform},

Improving on aggregate comparisons, I examine the sorting of students into charter schools by tracking individual students from their charter school of enrollment back to the school they were enrolled in immediately prior to the switch to a charter school, allowing for a direct comparison of school racial demographics between the two sectors. I find evidence that the process of charter school choice in Indianapolis leads to higher degrees of racial isolation and less diversity within schools than is present in the underlying process of student school transfers in the public school district from which a majority of these students came.},

  abstract = {purchased on Google Books Surveying the two centuries that preceded Jim Crow’s demise, Race and Education in New Orleans traces the course of the city’s education system from the colonial period to the start of school desegregation in 1960. This timely historical analysis reveals that public schools in New Orleans both suffered from and maintained the racial stratification that characterized urban areas for much of the twentieth century.Walter C. Stern begins his account with the mid-eighteenth-century kidnapping and enslavement of Marie Justine Sirnir, who eventually secured her freedom and played a major role in the development of free black education in the Crescent City. As Sirnir’s story and legacy illustrate, schools such as the one she envisioned were central to the black antebellum understanding of race, citizenship, and urban development. Black communities fought tirelessly to gain better access to education, which gave rise to new strategies by white civilians and officials who worked to maintain and strengthen the racial status quo, even as they conceded to demands from the black community for expanded educational opportunities. The friction between black and white New Orleanians continued throughout the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth, when conflicts over land and resources sharply intensified. Stern argues that the post-Reconstruction reorganization of the city into distinct black and white enclaves marked a new phase in the evolution of racial disparity: segregated schools gave rise to segregated communities, which in turn created structural inequality in housing that impeded desegregation’s capacity to promote racial justice.By taking a long view of the interplay between education, race, and urban change, Stern underscores the fluidity of race as a social construct and the extent to which the Jim Crow system evolved through a dynamic though often improvisational process. A vital and accessible history, Race and Education in New Orleans provides a comprehensive look at the ways the New Orleans school system shaped the city’s racial and urban landscapes.},

  abstract = {Compton, California, is often associated in the public mind with urban America's toughest problems, including economic disinvestment, gang violence, and failing public schools. Before it became synonymous with inner-city decay, however, Compton's affordability, proximity to manufacturing jobs, and location ten miles outside downtown Los Angeles made it attractive to aspiring suburbanites seeking single-family homes and quality schools. As Compton faced challenges in the twentieth century, and as the majority population shifted from white to African American and then to Latino, the battle for control over the school district became symbolic of Compton's economic, social, and political crises.Death of a Suburban Dream explores the history of Compton from its founding in the late nineteenth century to the present, taking on three critical issues—the history of race and educational equity, the relationship between schools and place, and the complicated intersection of schooling and municipal economies—as they shaped a Los Angeles suburb experiencing economic and demographic transformation. Emily E. Straus carefully traces the roots of antagonism between two historically disenfranchised populations, blacks and Latinos, as these groups resisted municipal power sharing within a context of scarcity. Using archival research and oral histories, this complex narrative reveals how increasingly racialized poverty and violence made Compton, like other inner-ring suburbs, resemble a troubled urban center. Ultimately, the book argues that Compton's school crisis is not, at heart, a crisis of education; it is a long-term crisis of development.Avoiding simplistic dichotomies between urban and suburban, Death of a Suburban Dream broadens our understanding of the dynamics connecting residents and institutions of the suburbs, as well as the changing ethnic and political landscape in metropolitan America.},

  abstract = {originally published 1979 By the turn of the twentieth century, academic nativism had taken root in elite American colleges—specifically, Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant hegemony was endangered by new kinds of student, many of them Catholic and Jewish immigrants. The newcomers threatened to displace native-born Americans by raising academic standards and winning a disproportionate share of the scholarships.The Half-Opened Door analyzes the role of these institutions, casting light on their place in class structure and values in the United States. It details the origins, history, and demise of discriminatory admissions processes and depicts how the entrenched position of the upper class was successfully challenged. The educational, and hence economic, mobility of Catholics and Jews has shown other groups—for example, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Spanish-speaking Americans—not only the difficulties that these earlier aspirants had in overcoming class and ethnic barriers, but the fact that it can be done.One of the ironies of the history of higher education in the United States is the use of quotas by admissions committees. Restrictive measures were imposed on Jews because they were so successful, whereas benign quotas are currently used to encourage underrepresented minorities to enter colleges and professional schools. The competing claims of both the older and the newer minorities continue to be the subject of controversy, editorial comments, and court cases—and will be for years to come.},

  abstract = {https://muse-jhu-edu.ezproxy.trincoll.edu/book/67829 By the late 1960s and early 1970s, reeling from a wave of urban uprisings, politicians finally worked to end the practice of redlining. Reasoning that the turbulence could be calmed by turning Black city-dwellers into homeowners, they passed the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, and set about establishing policies to induce mortgage lenders and the real estate industry to treat Black homebuyers equally. The disaster that ensued revealed that racist exclusion had not been eradicated, but rather transmuted into a new phenomenon of predatory inclusion. Race for Profit uncovers how exploitative real estate practices continued well after housing discrimination was banned. The same racist structures and individuals remained intact after redlining's end, and close relationships between regulators and the industry created incentives to ignore improprieties. Meanwhile, new policies meant to encourage low-income homeownership created new methods to exploit Black homeowners. The federal government guaranteed urban mortgages in an attempt to overcome resistance to lending to Black buyers – as if unprofitability, rather than racism, was the cause of housing segregation. Bankers, investors, and real estate agents took advantage of the perverse incentives, targeting the Black women most likely to fail to keep up their home payments and slip into foreclosure, multiplying their profits. As a result, by the end of the 1970s, the nation's first programs to encourage Black homeownership ended with tens of thousands of foreclosures in Black communities across the country. The push to uplift Black homeownership had descended into a goldmine for realtors and mortgage lenders, and a ready-made cudgel for the champions of deregulation to wield against government intervention of any kind. Narrating the story of a sea-change in housing policy and its dire impact on African Americans, Race for Profit reveals how the urban core was transformed into a new frontier of cynical extraction.},

Merging together several data sets, including Common Core of Data, census data, and shapefiles at multiple geographic scales, we measure segregation of public school students and the entire population over time. We show that school district secession is restructuring school segregation in the counties where secession is occurring, with segregation increasingly occurring because students attend different school districts. Additionally, in the most recent year of analysis, residents were increasingly stratified by race in different school districts. Segregation patterns differ substantially, however, depending on the history of secession in the county.},

  abstract = {"This article illuminates how the Seligman affair transformed from a symbol of the precarity of American Jews' civil rights to scholars' primary example of social anti-Semitism. In tracing this shift, I show that the Seligman affair exemplifies what I call legally sanctioned anti-Semitism: anti-Jewish discrimination enabled by state and federal legislation or permitted by the judiciary. As a classification, legally sanctioned anti-Semitism applies to assorted incidents that scholars have understood as disparate and anomalous. For example, it characterizes instances of express discrimination such as when New Hampshire's constitution required state officeholders to be Protestant (a prerequisite that lasted until 1877). Secondly, it describes seemingly neutral legislation that disproportionately disadvantaged Jews because of their Jewish practices or identities. For example, Sunday closing laws that restrained Jews' power to trade on the Christian Sabbath harmed Jewish workers' capacity to earn money because Jews also refrained from trade on Saturdays in recognition of the Jewish Sabbath. Third, legally sanctioned anti-Semitism characterizes lawmakers' failure to ensure Jews' rights by neglecting to pass protective legislation. Quotas limiting the number of Jewish students at private universities may have been inspired by anti-Jewish animus, but the legality of such policies depended on the absence of legislation prohibiting such quotas. Fourth, legally sanctioned anti-Semitism highlights circumstances in which parties knowingly violated laws based on the judiciary's tacit assurance of legality. Hilton, for example, conceded that he probably had violated the law when he excluded Seligman, anticipating that he would not face legal repercussions. Finally, legally sanctioned anti-Semitism reflects the judiciary's endorsement of anti-Jewish discrimination through “rights-denying court decisions” in which judges struck down protective legislation, thereby making policy choices about Americans' freedoms. The 1883 decision on the group of five cases that constituted the Civil Rights Cases and the 1896 Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, for example, legally permitted white business owners to exclude Jews (and, of course, Black Americans) from places of public accommodation. Ultimately, these episodes are connected by the fact that, in each case, non-Jews employed the legal system to institutionalize anti-Jewish bias"},

The school governance council is a group of parents and teachers. By Wednesday, a followup statement was e-mailed to reporters saying the meeting should have been open. "The meeting was considered a public meeting. This was our error," a spokesman wrote. But the reversal was based largely on a technicality. Because the meeting was announced as a governance council meeting, which are established by state law in dozens of schools across the state, it must be open to the public. It remains to be seen if the district will open other community meetings to the press. The statement released Wednesday by the district doesn't provide much hope.},

  abstract = {Spoiler alert: Racism still exists. And research shows it affects lending. "For a study published last year in a journal from Oxford University Press, a team of researchers (Bone et al 2014) from Rutgers, Brigham Young and Utah State universities sent “mystery shoppers” into about 80 banks. They posed as small business owners looking for a loan. They all had the same story and the same outfit — and were even selected to be equally tall and good looking — but some were black, some were white and some were Latino. As one of the researchers, Rutgers business professor Jerome Williams, puts it: “We found significant differences.” The study found bank officers asked tougher questions of minority applicants. For instance, they wanted to see more years of financial records. The mystery shoppers also used hidden cameras.  According to the study, everybody who saw the tapes agreed: bank officers were just nicer to white applicants. With white applicants, Williams says, “There was a lot of bantering, interaction, jokes — being very, very friendly.” With the black and Latino mystery shoppers, not so much. It led to a simple conclusion. For black and Latino entrepreneurs looking for a bank loan, “The playing field is not level,” Williams says. “There’s already a mark against you in terms of your background in applying for a loan.”},

This important book tells the story of how two school districts--one a predominantly White and wealthy suburban community and the other a more diverse and urbanized community--were merged into a single district to work toward a solution for school segregation. The authors focus on the Morris School District in New Jersey as an exemplar to demonstrate what is possible and how it can be accomplished. They document what makes a district like Morris successful and include lessons learned in each chapter. Along with analyzing the legal and educational policy implications of the nearly 50-year history of the merged district, the authors take a mixed methods approach to deepen our knowledge of effective leadership, community-school relations, and classroom practices in the context of a community committed to genuine integration. Book Features:  Offers a deep analysis of one of the few districts that is making progress toward true integration.  Examines a local story that has wide applicability to those interested in social justice, enlightened leadership, and equitable educational opportunities for all students.  Employs qualitative and quantitative research along with GIS mapping to study the legal, educational, political, historical, and sociological dimensions of the case study. Provides a series of lessons learned from the Morris School District that will assist those engaged in building equitable school systems.},

  location = {{Hartford}},
  abstract = {This thesis is structured to investigate notions of community, and the trials and issues that surround it, through four case studies in the Hartford area between 1833 and 1841. The first chapter of this thesis centers on the case of Prudence Crandall and her attempt to open a school for African American girls in 1833 in Canterbury, Connecticut, a small village outside of Hartford. It shows how Crandall, a white Quaker, was drawn to black activism not simply through the immediatist rhetoric of Garrison (as historians have previously established), but through the free black individuals she came in contact with. These women and men taught her, and other white activists, about the plight of free blacks in Connecticut and about the needs of the black community. The chapter will also show the tremendous prejudice and exclusion faced by free black communities in Connecticut. Due to the complicated legacy of gradual abolition in Connecticut, the fear of amalgamation among whites, and other factors, blacks were effectively cut off from broader society. This exclusion was enforced by legal codes, intimidation, and violence. It is under these conditions that it was necessary for the black community of Hartford, and black communities throughout the North, to cooperate and subsist by any means necessary. 	Chapter Two looks at the role of the Hartford black community, and other similar black communities, in resistance style activism, specifically immediatist abolitionism and Underground Railroad resistance. It argues that the origin of immediatism is found not in evangelicalism or white abolitionist rhetoric, but rather in black communities, enslaved and free. Slave rebellions, free black militancy, and responses to conditions faced by free blacks in the North as well as to the colonization debate all inspired immediatist abolitionism. One of the most important acts of resistance—simultaneously representing a catalyst of and a response to immediatism—was slave flight. The escape of slaves created tension between the North and the South, illuminated many Northerners as to the plight of the enslaved, gave the abolition movement some of its finest figures, and led to the Fugitive Slave Law—a piece of legislation that in many ways set the nation on course for the Civil War. This chapter will look at the Underground Railroad as a network of dedicated activism located in individual and free black community resistance. It examines the typical profile of fugitives and the ways in which new research has broadened the scope of this profile.  	Chapter Two also highlights the epic story of John Lindsay Smith’s escape from enslavement in Virginia. Smith’s journey took him by land and by sea, travelling at times with companions and at other times alone. He benefitted from the assistance of many Northern blacks, including the prolific Underground Railroad “conductor” David Ruggles and the black community in Hartford. Smith’s narrative gives us insight into the factors that motivated slave flight, the trials that fugitives faced in their passage North, and the ways in which assistance from brave individuals along the way was indispensible on the flight to freedom. 	Chapter Three examines the case of the slave ship Amistad. It demonstrates how white abolitionists, activists within the free black community, and the ship’s captives all contributed to the eventual freedom of the Africans. The chapter elaborates on how these three groups form a community of resistance. The Amistad case is a starting point to discuss the benefits and tensions surrounding interracial activism during this time period. This chapter will look at the trials faced by the Amistad captives as well as at their courage, poise, and wisdom in the face of these struggles. Lewis Tappan as a leading advocate and organizer in the abolitionist support of the Africans is examined in the chapter. It focuses on the tension between Tappan and Reverend James Pennington—over the movement to utilize the Africans as part of a Christian mission to West Africa—to illuminate the distrust and paternalism that often made interracial activism difficult. But it simultaneously highlights the ways in which interracial activism offered unique advantages and was critical to the abolitionist movement. 	Finally, Chapter Four will examine the motivations and philosophies behind localized community improvement activism, through the lens of Reverend Pennington’s early work in Hartford in 1840-1841. It attempts to place Pennington’s work within the black activist tradition of the period, and to open a dialogue about the integrationist versus separationist motivations within self-improvement activism while simultaneously placing Pennington on that spectrum. Pennington’s experiences with enslavement and his writing to reveal the motivations behind his work in community-based activism are central evidence. This chapter will also discuss the ways in which the racism and exclusion outline in Chapter One necessitated strong, insular, self-sustaining black communities in the North—often gathered around churches such as Pennington’s Talcott Street Church.  	The common thread that unites these four moments is that they all represent community responses to systemic injustice. The courage of a Quaker schoolteacher in the face of racial fears and intimidation, the selfless resistance of Underground Railroad agents against the institution of slavery, the laborious cooperation between white and black activists in a legal battle against the federal government, and the tireless work of a young fugitive slave to uplift the Hartford black community all display the power of marginalized communities to not only sustain themselves in the face of exclusion, but also to affect national change.},

The study’s findings confirm a hard truth: that America’s long journey to end housing discrimination remains unfinished. Real estate agents and rental housing providers recommend and show fewer available homes and apartments to minorities than equally qualified whites. Although the most blatant forms of housing discrimination have declined since the first national paired-testing study in 1977, the forms that persist raise the costs of housing search for minorities and restrict their housing options. Looking forward, national fair housing policies must continue to adapt to address the patterns of discrimination and disparity that persist today.},

About 56 percent of the structures with nonwhite owners were built in 1929 or earlier, while only 41 percent with white owners were built in those years."

The Buildings The Wadsworth Atheneum is comprised of five connected buildings. The first was the Gothic Revival Wadsworth building of 1844, designed by the eminent architects Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis. It originally housed the art gallery, the Connecticut Historical Society, the Young Men’s Institute (which became the Hartford Public Library), and the Natural History Society. The Watkinson Library of Reference was added to the original building in the 1860s . . . By 1964, the institutions not affiliated with the art museum had moved to other Hartford locations. When the Goodwin building, designed in a late modernist style, opened to the public in 1969, the entire facility was devoted to the fine arts for the first time, Daniel Wadsworth’s original intention."},

  abstract = {This qualitative study is designed to apply educational anthropologist John Ogbu’s cultural-­‐ ecological theory of minority school performance to school choice by examining choice differences between two racially similar but ethnically different minority groups in the Hartford region. Parents in Harford, Connecticut, have several different public school choice options available to them, including intra-­‐district choice, regional magnet schools, and a suburban district transfer program known as Open Choice. For all of these options, school choice is designed to improve opportunities for Hartford students. Drawing on data from five interviews with West Indian immigrant parents and three interviews with native-­‐born African American parents, this study suggests that while Ogbu’s theory might sufficiently be able to explain differences regarding parental orientation to school choice and proximity, it indicates that the theory does not effectively explain ethnic differences in parental orientation to education in general or orientation to the local urban school system for African American and West Indian parents in Hartford. Additionally, given the exponential expansion of school choice policies within the last decade it is becoming increasingly important to question both the role of ethnicity in school choice and, more broadly, the effectiveness of school choice policies in low-­‐income minority communities nationally.},

From the origins of unequal public school funding after the Civil War through school desegregation cases from Brown v. Board of Education to San Antonio v. Rodriguez in the 1970s, this study spans over a century of racial injustice, dramatic courtroom clashes, and white supremacist backlash to collective justice claims.Incorporating letters from everyday individuals as well as the private notes of Supreme Court justices as they deliberated, Walsh reveals how the idea of a "taxpayer" identity contributed to the contemporary crises of public education, racial disparity, and income inequality.},

  abstract = {website summary: This study underscores pervasive racial and ethnic segregation across Long Island’s School Districts and how our suburban system of disparate villages and hamlets impacts students’ equal access to high quality education.     * Why Boundaries Matter (Unabridged: 86 pages)     * Why Boundaries Matter (Abridged: 12 pages)     * Press Release     * Op-Ed Article Note: If you would like to learn more about a Long Island school district that has successfully eliminated academic tracks and educates all students to the highest level, read more about Rockville Centre at: http://www.tc.edu/news/article.htm?id=6609. Garden City, NY (October 1, 2009) - A Long Island Index Special Report, “Why Boundaries Matter: A Study of Five Separate and Unequal Long Island School Districts,” finds alarming disparities among Long Island’s school districts. The report, based on a study conducted by Teachers College, Columbia University, aims to understand how Long Island’s system of delivering educational services across 125 districts impacts students’ access to a high quality education. The study’s author, Amy Stuart Wells, Professor of Sociology and Education at Teachers College, explains, “Although this study is about Long Island’s educational system, it is indicative of what is occurring in suburbs across our country. The segregation that occurs here and the accompanying impact on education funding and quality typifies what’s happening across America and is a national concern.”   Dr. Wells and her colleagues studied five different Long Island school districts, each representing a specific demographic trend on the Island, and conducted interviews with more than 75 school administrators, teachers, students, parents and school board members. In order to maintain the confidentiality of the interviews, the names of the school districts have been changed to pseudonyms. “What we hear in these voices – whether they are privileged, affluent white students in a low needs district or educators struggling to provide an ‘adequate' education for the poorest students of color in a high-needs district – is how the separateness defines them and their educational opportunities” said Dr. Wells. The study sheds new light on the following:     * How public school districts with more resources are able to generate higher levels of public funding and further supplement that funding through private resources from parents, community members and other donors who are connected to the district.      * How the inequities become wider in this type of system as wealthier schools have greater ability to offer students wider selections of courses, better teachers and more access to opportunities. “In poorer schools their ‘ceiling’ is meeting state mandates” said Dr. Wells. “For more affluent schools the academic ‘floor’ is even higher than the poorer schools’ ceiling”.      * How the types of support systems that students at wealthier schools typically have in place, inside and outside of school – and that students in less affluent districts often lack -- help them through the difficult times. The presence or absence of such supports weighs more heavily than the kinds of problems or challenges students face in affluent versus poor communities.     * How school and district reputations can become self-fulfilling prophecies, with poorer districts unable to attract more affluent residents or more prepared educators. “We found that in some wealthy districts, there were hundreds of applicants for a single teaching job, while in poorer districts just miles away, schools had difficulty attracting a single applicant for a teaching job” said Dr. Wells. As a result, these ways of “knowing” school districts through their reputations helps to legitimize the separation and inequality across districts that so many people on Long Island say is morally wrong.  Nancy Rauch Douzinas, president of the Rauch Foundation and publisher of the Long Island Index, noted that, “If the Island is to rebuild its economic engine and provide the high quality jobs we were once known for, we have to address the economic and structural divide among our school districts. We cannot meet the needs of the future if we continue to allow today’s disparities to continue. Building 125 walls between 125 districts has led to great social injustice, intolerable property tax costs and will ultimately lead to failure”. In one of the districts studied by the Teachers College research team, the issues of diversity are front and center as the teachers and administrators grapple with whether or not to alter their existing system of separating middle school students into “Honors” and “Regular” classes. In the current system, the Honors classes tend to be disproportionately white while the regular classes are disproportionately African American and Latino. One administrator equates it to “apartheid.” “The Long Island suburban school system has taken a national problem of separating children to a higher and more damaging level” noted Ann Golob, Director of the Long Island Index. “Although we have been re-segregating for the past three decades, many school districts are quietly finding alternatives that open the door to opportunities to more students. De-tracking is one option for districts that have diverse populations but segregated classrooms within the school.  But for those districts where homogeneity – whether largely white and Asian or alternatively, African American and Latino – is the norm, a wider set of programs and policies need to be considered.” Despite the rigidity of the existing school district structure, the authors point to several options that could be adopted by Long Islanders to incorporate greater flexibility and give all students greater exposure to an expanded array of opportunities. These include:     * Give BOCES (Nassau Board of Cooperative Educational Services) a greater role in helping students cross school district boundaries and gain exposure to a more diverse mix of students by creating more “magnet” schools or expanded educational programs beyond the current array of vocational, special education and arts programs.     * Create a series of “choice-oriented programs”, similar to the ones that exist throughout the country, that allow students to transfer between districts in order to attend a wider variety of schools.     * Find innovative ways to make school district boundaries more porous allowing the flow of students and teachers across them for special events, classes and programs.     * Look to the NYS legislature to create policies and programs that support and sustain integrated educational opportunities. Resources for faculty recruitment and development to help educators address issues of tracking and re-segregation within racially and ethnically diverse schools.      * Amend New York State Laws to provide fewer public funds to private schools. In some districts the proportion of funds that flow out from the public schools  Under the terms of the Long Island Index study, the names of the schools that were the focus of Dr. Wells’ research cannot be released. However, the Long Island Index and Teachers College can provide the media access to South Side High School in Rockville Centre, on Long Island, a school where nearly 40\% of the school’s black and Hispanic students are candidates for the International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma, a two-year college-credit program similar to Advanced Placement. Fifteen years ago, virtually no students of color at South Side were taking IB or AP courses. Now, thanks to the school’s decision to eliminate tracks (categories that separate those who are college-bound from those deemed not to be) the school averages fewer than five dropouts per year, every student takes accelerated math and nearly all take calculus. Black and Latino students in Rockville Centre also have higher rates of earning the New York State regents diploma than do white students statewide. To read more about the South Side High and issues of segregation and school quality in suburbia, visit http://www.tc.edu/news/article.htm?id=6609.    “Let’s hope that Long Islanders heed the call of both the Long Island Index Report 2009 and this more qualitative analysis of inequality and choose to take action to make their suburban setting a model for the future of a diverse society and not a throw back to a past of white flight, inequality and hyper-segregation created and reinforced during the 20th Century,” said Dr. Wells.},

However, limited research exists that explores how suburban district leaders are responding to such changes, and what factors may shape their responses. To better understand how districts within these communities are responding to suburban diversification, we conducted a qualitative case study of a large and rapidly changing suburban district. We interviewed top-level district administrators, principals, and teachers at three case study schools that were undergoing particularly rapid demographic shifts. We found that instead of directly addressing issues of race in the district, the district’s response was colorblind in design: It was racially conscious of changes in student demographics, but its practices to address these changes were race-neutral. Findings suggest that districts must assert a framework for responding to issues of race in the face of demographic change.},

  abstract = {Zoning has had an unmistakable impact on the American built environment. It is very significant then that federal policy has had an impact on zoning. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has been a significant instrument for this policy. It has biased zoning toward the production of suburban development, an urban form marked by sprawling forms and the strict segregation of uses. While the FHA’s impact on racial segregation and the marketplace have been well researched, the FHA’s impact on zoning, and therefore on the vital components of urban form including the arrangement of uses and densities, has not been. Using a case study of the Los Angeles experience, this paper argues that the FHA, by offering a financing option for products much in demand, persuaded cities to adjust their zoning according to federal standards. The FHA provided a convincing case that zoning for lower-density residential uses and preserving them was the best way to accommodate the huge market of hopeful homeowners eager to acquire FHA-backed mortgages.},

When Crandall accepted a black woman as a student, she unleashed a storm of controversy that catapulted her to national notoriety, and drew the attention of the most significant pro- and anti-slavery activists of the day. The Connecticut state legislature passed its infamous Black Law in an attempt to close down her school. Arrested and jailed, Crandall’s legal legacy had a lasting impact—Crandall v. State was the first full-throated civil rights case in U.S. history. The arguments by attorneys in Crandall played a role in two of the most fateful Supreme Court decisions, Dred Scott v. Sandford, and the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education. In Prudence Crandall’s Legacy, author and lawyer Donald E. Williams Jr. marshals a wealth of detail concerning the life and work of Prudence Crandall, her unique role in the fight for civil rights, and her influence on legal arguments for equality in America.},

  abstract = {Prudence Crandall was a schoolteacher who fought to integrate her school in Canterbury, Connecticut, and educate black women in the early nineteenth century. When Crandall accepted a black woman as a student, she unleashed a storm of controversy that catapulted her to national notoriety, and drew the attention of the most significant pro- and anti-slavery activists of the day. The Connecticut state legislature passed its infamous Black Law in an attempt to close down her school. Arrested and jailed, Crandall's legal legacy had a lasting impact—Crandall v. State was the first full-throated civil rights case in U.S. history. The arguments by attorneys in Crandall played a role in two of the most fateful Supreme Court decisions, Dred Scott v. Sandford, and the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education. In Prudence Crandall's Legacy, author and lawyer Donald E. Williams Jr. marshals a wealth of detail concerning the life and work of Prudence Crandall, her unique role in the fight for civil rights, and her influence on legal arguments for equality in America.},

This is the first book of its kind to bring together scholars and community partners to, in collaboration with each other, discuss, often in their own voices, community-engaged digital projects. Through a series of case studies authored by these teams, this edited volume explores models for cross-disciplinary digital community engagement that leverages new media through reciprocal partnerships. The contributions to the volume stand at the crossroads of digital humanities, public history, and community engagement, drawing ideas, methods, and practices from various disciplines to inform our public partnerships. The contributors "lift the hood" on their projects, so to speak, by detailing what made each project successful and meaningful. They also describe how the digital components changed their approaches and outcomes. By highlighting these projects, the authors provide other institutions with roadmaps and ideas for cultural heritage organizations, universities, and communities' models of successful engagement and tips on how to navigate the fragile relationships between communities and the academy"--},

In particular, they show how the evolution of the charter movement has shaped research questions and findings.By highlighting what we know about the conditions for success in charter schools, the authors make a significant contribution to current debates in policy and practice, both within the charter sector and in the larger landscape of public education.},

  abstract = {By utilizing the annual reports of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) and its monthly journal, the Federal Home Loan Bank Review, this essay argues that the incorporation of the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation’s appraisal scheme had several detrimental consequences. By mandating their appraisal analysis as a prerequisite for membership into the federal banking system, the FHLBB established unified national lending standards designed to evaluate neighborhood demographics as a factor far exceeding the condition of the appraised property itself. With the inclusion of these “scientific appraisal standards” into their uniform lending policies, FHLBB officials rated entire residential communities as hazardous bank investments whenever they were inhabited by undesirable occupants. Ultimately, the standardized lending policies of the FHLBB systematically disadvantaged low-income and minority city-dwelling residents from obtaining mortgage financing, and by midcentury they exacerbated the disproportionately substandard urban housing conditions endured by nonwhites in the United States. case study of Los Angeles, compare with Amy Hillier on Philadelphia},

Have these spatially restrictive credit designations influenced home value, homeownership, and racial segregation? Using the FHA mortgage risk map of Chicago, Illinois, for new loan guarantees as a case study, I measure outcomes between credit zones and compare these risk regions with the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) Residential Security Maps, which represent post hoc measures of mortgage risk and were likely not directly used in loan activities. For areas excluded from FHA loan guarantees, the results suggest a negative impact on home values and homeownership rates and weakly decreased segregation between 1940 and 1980. They also suggest an overcorrection of home values, an undercorrection of homeownership, and an increase in racial segregation in excluded neighborhoods between 1980 and 2010 when these areas may have experienced capital reinvestment. In comparison with the HOLC map, the effects on tracts in Chicago rated worst by the FHA are clearer and suggest a more significant impact during the period of discriminatory mortgage lending.},

By analyzing statistically significant patterns among over 33,000 Hartford-resident HPS students in grades 3 to 8 from 2008-09 to 2011-12, we found that the proportion of high-achieving students who left the HPS dataset is not significantly different from the proportion who stayed (around 15 to 18 percent) over time, but there are significant differences in school zone, magnet school status, and other variables.},
