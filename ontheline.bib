  abstract = {This quantitative study measures achievement differences between students who enrolled in Open Choice (a city-to-suburb voluntary school integration busing program, previously known as Project Concern, and a key remedy in the Sheff case), versus applicants who were not admitted by lottery.
The study was based on 140 students who applied to enter the Choice program for the 1999-2000 academic year, in grades 5-8. Through the random lottery, 42 were accepted into the Choice program, while 98 remained in a control group. Using students' CMT scores, the author wrote the following: "In this study, I compare standardized achievement test scores of Choice and control students in order to estimate the effects of majority-to-minority transfer on the academic performance of Hartford students.  I find that treatment students perform better than controls in reading and, to a lesser extent, in math.  Writing scores, however, are lower for Choice students than for controls.  Although there is a trend toward more positive effects as the number of years in treatment increases, this change is largely the result of the movement of students between treatment and control after the initial allocation of groups.  When the sample is divided into lower- and higher-income groups, new patterns of achievement emerge.  Lower-income Choice students perform worse in all subject areas compared to lower-income controls.  Achievement for higher income students, however, appears to be affected more positively by participation in Open Choice, as these treatment students perform better than controls in both reading and math, though not in writing.  These findings suggest that while participation in the program academically benefits higher-income students, it has a more negative effect on the achievement of lower-income students.  Despite the intentions of policy makers, those students who are most disadvantaged do not appear to benefit from Open Choice. " p8-9},

Drawing upon historical and qualitative research methods, it examines how different Latino politicians, activists, and parents viewed the original purpose of the magnet school project -- and how they continue to address conflicts that have arisen during the past five years of implementation. In addition to archival analysis of ten years of documents and statistics, the study draws upon twenty-nine semi-structured interviews with key advocates. Major findings reveal how city-suburban magnet schools have been a two-edged blade for Hartford’s Latino residents, resulting in important tangible and symbolic gains for some, but diluting benefits that were originally slated for Hartford’s neighborhood youth.},

We created SmartChoices, a public school search tool for the Hartford, Connecticut region, conducted parent workshops (with hands-on instruction in English and Spanish) to narrow the digital divide, and collected quantitative and qualitative data to investigate how it influenced their decision-making processes. Based on our small sample of ninety-three workshop participants, we found that two-thirds either clarified or changed their top-ranked school after receiving guidance on using the website. Furthermore, several also found what they defined as "better" schools (with higher test scores or more racially-balanced student populations) that were located closer to their neighborhood than their initial top-rated choices. But making information more widely available is not a neutral act, as some parents used our search tool to avoid schools with high concentrations of students from racial groups other than their own. Overall, this study contributes to the scholarly literature that views school choice as a double-edged sword, with potentially positive outcomes for some families and negative consequences for others left behind.},

Jack Dougherty counters this interpretation, demonstrating that black activists engaged in multiple, overlapping, and often conflicting strategies to advance the race by gaining greater control over schools. Dougherty tells the story of black school reform movements in Milwaukee from the 1930s to the 1990s, highlighting the multiple perspectives within each generation. In profiles of four leading activists, he reveals how different generations redefined the meaning of the Brown decision over time to fit the historical conditions of their particular struggles. William Kelley of the Urban League worked to win teaching jobs for blacks and to resettle Southern black migrant children in the 1950s; Lloyd Barbee of the NAACP organized protests in support of integrated schools and the teaching of black history in the 1960s; and Marian McEvilly and Howard Fuller contested--in different ways--the politics of implementing desegregation in the 1970s, paving the way for the 1990s private school voucher movement. Dougherty concludes by contrasting three interpretations of the progress made in the fifty years since Brown, showing how historical perspective can shed light on contemporary debates over race and education reform.},

for assisting very low-income families, the elderly, and the disabled to afford housing in the private market. 
CFHC’s objective was to determine what factors influence the housing choices of low-income housing choice 
voucher holders and what inhibits these residents from using their vouchers to move from struggling communities to areas with less crime, thriving schools and lower poverty rates (so-called “opportunity moves”). 
This report explores how low-income people of color make their housing decisions and identifies 
impediments to those who have considered, but not made, opportunity moves. The findings include a series 
of recommendations from the participating voucher holders themselves about strategies for eliminating 
barriers to such opportunity moves." (Stefanie DeLuca research model)},

  abstract = {This qualitative study is designed to apply educational anthropologist John Ogbu’s cultural-­‐ ecological theory of minority school performance to school choice by examining choice differences between two racially similar but ethnically different minority groups in the Hartford region. Parents in Harford, Connecticut, have several different public school choice options available to them, including intra-­‐district choice, regional magnet schools, and a suburban district transfer program known as Open Choice. For all of these options, school choice is designed to improve opportunities for Hartford students. Drawing on data from five interviews with West Indian immigrant parents and three interviews with native-­‐born African American parents, this study suggests that while Ogbu’s theory might sufficiently be able to explain differences regarding parental orientation to school choice and proximity, it indicates that the theory does not effectively explain ethnic differences in parental orientation to education in general or orientation to the local urban school system for African American and West Indian parents in Hartford. Additionally, given the exponential expansion of school choice policies within the last decade it is becoming increasingly important to question both the role of ethnicity in school choice and, more broadly, the effectiveness of school choice policies in low-­‐income minority communities nationally.},

But enrollment numbers tell a different story.

Just one of the 432 students who attended Jumoke last school year spoke limited English, while in other schools in Hartford, 18 percent spoke limited English.

Likewise, 4 percent of Jumoke students require special education compared with 15 percent in Hartford.},

  shorttitle = {Why Boundaries Matter},
  abstract = {website summary: This study underscores pervasive racial and ethnic segregation across Long Island’s School Districts and how our suburban system of disparate villages and hamlets impacts students’ equal access to high quality education.     * Why Boundaries Matter (Unabridged: 86 pages)     * Why Boundaries Matter (Abridged: 12 pages)     * Press Release     * Op-Ed Article Note: If you would like to learn more about a Long Island school district that has successfully eliminated academic tracks and educates all students to the highest level, read more about Rockville Centre at: http://www.tc.edu/news/article.htm?id=6609. Garden City, NY (October 1, 2009) - A Long Island Index Special Report, “Why Boundaries Matter: A Study of Five Separate and Unequal Long Island School Districts,” finds alarming disparities among Long Island’s school districts. The report, based on a study conducted by Teachers College, Columbia University, aims to understand how Long Island’s system of delivering educational services across 125 districts impacts students’ access to a high quality education. The study’s author, Amy Stuart Wells, Professor of Sociology and Education at Teachers College, explains, “Although this study is about Long Island’s educational system, it is indicative of what is occurring in suburbs across our country. The segregation that occurs here and the accompanying impact on education funding and quality typifies what’s happening across America and is a national concern.”   Dr. Wells and her colleagues studied five different Long Island school districts, each representing a specific demographic trend on the Island, and conducted interviews with more than 75 school administrators, teachers, students, parents and school board members. In order to maintain the confidentiality of the interviews, the names of the school districts have been changed to pseudonyms. “What we hear in these voices – whether they are privileged, affluent white students in a low needs district or educators struggling to provide an ‘adequate' education for the poorest students of color in a high-needs district – is how the separateness defines them and their educational opportunities” said Dr. Wells. The study sheds new light on the following:     * How public school districts with more resources are able to generate higher levels of public funding and further supplement that funding through private resources from parents, community members and other donors who are connected to the district.      * How the inequities become wider in this type of system as wealthier schools have greater ability to offer students wider selections of courses, better teachers and more access to opportunities. “In poorer schools their ‘ceiling’ is meeting state mandates” said Dr. Wells. “For more affluent schools the academic ‘floor’ is even higher than the poorer schools’ ceiling”.      * How the types of support systems that students at wealthier schools typically have in place, inside and outside of school – and that students in less affluent districts often lack -- help them through the difficult times. The presence or absence of such supports weighs more heavily than the kinds of problems or challenges students face in affluent versus poor communities.     * How school and district reputations can become self-fulfilling prophecies, with poorer districts unable to attract more affluent residents or more prepared educators. “We found that in some wealthy districts, there were hundreds of applicants for a single teaching job, while in poorer districts just miles away, schools had difficulty attracting a single applicant for a teaching job” said Dr. Wells. As a result, these ways of “knowing” school districts through their reputations helps to legitimize the separation and inequality across districts that so many people on Long Island say is morally wrong.  Nancy Rauch Douzinas, president of the Rauch Foundation and publisher of the Long Island Index, noted that, “If the Island is to rebuild its economic engine and provide the high quality jobs we were once known for, we have to address the economic and structural divide among our school districts. We cannot meet the needs of the future if we continue to allow today’s disparities to continue. Building 125 walls between 125 districts has led to great social injustice, intolerable property tax costs and will ultimately lead to failure”. In one of the districts studied by the Teachers College research team, the issues of diversity are front and center as the teachers and administrators grapple with whether or not to alter their existing system of separating middle school students into “Honors” and “Regular” classes. In the current system, the Honors classes tend to be disproportionately white while the regular classes are disproportionately African American and Latino. One administrator equates it to “apartheid.” “The Long Island suburban school system has taken a national problem of separating children to a higher and more damaging level” noted Ann Golob, Director of the Long Island Index. “Although we have been re-segregating for the past three decades, many school districts are quietly finding alternatives that open the door to opportunities to more students. De-tracking is one option for districts that have diverse populations but segregated classrooms within the school.  But for those districts where homogeneity – whether largely white and Asian or alternatively, African American and Latino – is the norm, a wider set of programs and policies need to be considered.” Despite the rigidity of the existing school district structure, the authors point to several options that could be adopted by Long Islanders to incorporate greater flexibility and give all students greater exposure to an expanded array of opportunities. These include:     * Give BOCES (Nassau Board of Cooperative Educational Services) a greater role in helping students cross school district boundaries and gain exposure to a more diverse mix of students by creating more “magnet” schools or expanded educational programs beyond the current array of vocational, special education and arts programs.     * Create a series of “choice-oriented programs”, similar to the ones that exist throughout the country, that allow students to transfer between districts in order to attend a wider variety of schools.     * Find innovative ways to make school district boundaries more porous allowing the flow of students and teachers across them for special events, classes and programs.     * Look to the NYS legislature to create policies and programs that support and sustain integrated educational opportunities. Resources for faculty recruitment and development to help educators address issues of tracking and re-segregation within racially and ethnically diverse schools.      * Amend New York State Laws to provide fewer public funds to private schools. In some districts the proportion of funds that flow out from the public schools  Under the terms of the Long Island Index study, the names of the schools that were the focus of Dr. Wells’ research cannot be released. However, the Long Island Index and Teachers College can provide the media access to South Side High School in Rockville Centre, on Long Island, a school where nearly 40\% of the school’s black and Hispanic students are candidates for the International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma, a two-year college-credit program similar to Advanced Placement. Fifteen years ago, virtually no students of color at South Side were taking IB or AP courses. Now, thanks to the school’s decision to eliminate tracks (categories that separate those who are college-bound from those deemed not to be) the school averages fewer than five dropouts per year, every student takes accelerated math and nearly all take calculus. Black and Latino students in Rockville Centre also have higher rates of earning the New York State regents diploma than do white students statewide. To read more about the South Side High and issues of segregation and school quality in suburbia, visit http://www.tc.edu/news/article.htm?id=6609.    “Let’s hope that Long Islanders heed the call of both the Long Island Index Report 2009 and this more qualitative analysis of inequality and choose to take action to make their suburban setting a model for the future of a diverse society and not a throw back to a past of white flight, inequality and hyper-segregation created and reinforced during the 20th Century,” said Dr. Wells.},

"Please be advised that this evening's meeting of the Classical Magnet School Governance Council parents with Superintendent [Christina] Kishimoto is closed to the press," read the statement that went out to the media just before the meeting.

The school governance council is a group of parents and teachers.

By Wednesday, a followup statement was e-mailed to reporters saying the meeting should have been open.

"The meeting was considered a public meeting. This was our error," a spokesman wrote.

But the reversal was based largely on a technicality. Because the meeting was announced as a governance council meeting, which are established by state law in dozens of schools across the state, it must be open to the public.

It remains to be seen if the district will open other community meetings to the press. The statement released Wednesday by the district doesn't provide much hope.},

  abstract = {Suburban historians have generally neglected the role of schools as an explanatory factor in the transformation of twentieth-century U.S. metropolitan space, since public education does not fit neatly into their narrative. At the same time, educational historians have focused so intently on the rise and decline of big-city school systems that they have largely failed to account for suburbanization. This article seeks to bridge the gap by examining the rising practice of “shopping for schools,” the buying and selling of private homes to gain access to more desirable public school attendance zones. This case study of three communities near Hartford, Connecticut, traces the convergence of real estate interests, suburban homebuyers, and government officials, particularly as the postwar labor market increasingly rewarded higher levels of educational attainment. Shopping for schools not only brings together educational credentialism and suburban consumerism but also helps to explain increasing stratification among suburbs in recent decades.

In Raleigh, North Carolina, the board of education ignored popular protests when it relocated the district’s premier schools to new racially restricted suburbs on the city’s northwest side, knowing development would follow. Simultaneously, the board refused to build even a single school for the black middle-class suburbs located outside the heavily segregated southeastern section of town, despite numerous requests. The legacy of these school board actions shifted the city center northwest of Capitol Square and left black communities on the southeast side economically and politically isolated from the rest of the city. When Raleigh faced court-ordered busing in 1971, black and white students lived on opposite sides of downtown. As a result, meaningful integration had become an impossible task without extensive busing, as was true in metropolitan areas across the nation.},

The very bad news is that as this research comes to light, educational policy in U.S. schools is moving away from bilingualism. Since the late 1990s, a movement to restrict the use of languages other than English in instruction has gained ascendance, resulting in bans on bilingual instruction in three states so far — California, Arizona and Massachusetts — and the curtailing of bilingual education in many other states.},

  abstract = {Local financing of public schools in the United States leads to a bundling of two distinct choices – residential choice and school choice – and has been argued to increase the degree of socioeconomic segregation across school districts. A school finance reform, aimed at equalization of school finances, can in principle weaken this link between housing choice and choice of schools. In this paper, we study the impacts of the Michigan school finance reform of 1994 (Proposal A) on spatial segregation. The reform was a state initiative intended to equalize per-pupil expenditures between Michigan school districts and reduce the role of local financing. We find that Proposal A was responsible for increases in the value of housing stock in the lowest-spending school districts, and for improvements in several socioeconomic indicators in these districts, implying a decline in neighborhood sorting. We also find that the reform affected dispersion of incomes and educational attainment within school districts, increasing within-district heterogeneity in the lowest-spending school districts, while decreasing the same in the highest-spending districts. However, there is continued high demand for residence in the highest-spending communities, suggesting the importance of neighborhood peer effects ("local" social capital) and implying that even a comprehensive government aid program can fail to make a large impact on residential segregation.},

The study, "Housing Costs, Zoning, and Access to High-Scoring Schools," found that restrictive zoning laws were highly correlated with educational achievement gaps in the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. Three of the best examples? Bridgeport, Hartford and New Haven.

"I think that people are very much aware of the problem that where you live has a disproportionate impact on what school you go to," said Jonathan Rothwell, senior research analyst at the Washington, D.C.-based Brookings Institution and the author of the report. "It's just very expensive to live near a high-scoring school in many parts of the country."

What's less understood, he said, is how local governments can work to make it even costlier. "States like Connecticut and New Jersey and Massachusetts and New York are some of the states that are most notorious in terms of having suburban governments that aggressively limit the supply of affordable housing."},

This study presents evidence that interdistrict magnet schools have provided students from Connecticut’s central cities access to less racially and eco- nomically isolated educational environments and estimates the impact of attending a magnet school on student achievement. To address potential selection biases, the analyses exploit the random assignment that results from lottery-based admissions for a small set of schools, as well as value- added and fixed-effect estimators that rely on pre–magnet school measures of student achievement to obtain effect estimates for a broader set of interdistrict magnet schools. Results indicate that attendance at an interdistrict magnet high school has positive effects on the math and reading achievement of central city students and that interdistrict magnet middle schools have positive effects on reading achievement."},

  abstract = {Investigates parental demand and participation in Open Choice in Hartford from 2002 to 2006 (and acknowledges that policies have shifted since this time) While Frankenberg 2007 argued that the demand for Open Choice seats far exceeds the supply, this needs some qualification. First, due to the high rate of students who did not accept a lottery invitation to enroll in Open Choice, comparing only applicants to open seats overstates the number. Second, Open Choice participation varies widely across grade levels, with virtually all PreK-2 students with reasonable lottery numbers to be placed, but less so in higher grade levels. p2-3 See also the "sibling privilege" in Open Choice: 11 percent of applicants had sibling currently enrolled, and received lottery preference (which has the unintended effect of perpetuating racial patterns). **Spatial that authors may not have explored: Are urban families more likely to decline Open Choice placements as the location of the suburban school increases in distance from Hartford? **LOOK TO SEE HOW CREC vs RSCO decline data is collected. Does it include name of placement district/school? Conclusion: "In summary, Black students in Hartford are both more likely to apply to Open Choice and more likely to accept an offer to participate than are Hispanic students. The result is substantially higher participation rates among Black students than Hispanic students. Males and females are equally likely to apply to Open Choice, but females are more likely to accept an offer to participate, leading to slightly higher participation rates among females. Finally, we found some differences in participation by geography. Particularly, a relatively high percentage of students from school attendance zones located in the northern sections of Hartford apply to and participate in Open Choice. The concentration of Open Choice students from these attendance zones can be observed despite the fact that these areas are not located closer to districts that offer Open Choice seats. Efforts to expand Open Choice and to ensure equal access to all Hartford students should begin with investigations of why Hispanic students, males, and students from the southern sections of the city are less likely to participate." Note that although authors claim that "student race is not used in determining admissions" (p. 1), the CT statutes restrict the degree of participation by race and residence (see my Sheff chapter).},

Theoretical considerations suggest that how choice programs affect segregation will depend not only on the family preferences emphasized in the sociology literature but also on the linkages between student composition, school quality and student achievement emphasized in the economics literature. Reasonable assumptions about the distribution of preferences over race, class, and school characteristics suggest that the segregating choices of students from advantaged backgrounds are likely to outweigh any integrating choices by disadvantaged students. The results of our empirical analysis are consistent with these theoretical considerations. Using information on the actual schools students attend and on the schools in their assigned attendance zones, we find that schools in Durham are more segregated by race and class as a result of school choice programs than they would be if all students attended their geographically assigned schools. In addition, we find that the effects of choice on segregation by class are larger than the effects on segregation by race."},

We find that many advantaged students have used school choice programs in Durham to opt out of assigned schools with concentrations of disadvantaged students and to attend schools with higher achieving students. Comparisons of actual peer compositions with the counterfactual scenario indicate only small differences in peer composition for nonchoosers on average. More substantial differences in peer environment emerge, however, for students in schools with concentrations of disadvantaged students and schools located near choice schools attractive to high achievers.

This, we believe, is a function f how parents learn about schools suing the search features of the site." p131 RESTATED more clearly: "We believe that a number of these parents are combining the information they already have about teh demographic composition of schools and the demographic makeup of DC neighborhood with new information learnede from their seach to select a new school to view in depth. . . as the search proceeds, parents increasingly 'visit' schools that have lower percentages of black students." p132 ***CLEARER: "parents in our study are 'visiting' schools with better academic perfomrnace -- but, despite an unwillingness to admit this in telephone or face-to-face surveys, they are also seeking out schools with a lower percentage of black students" p133},

There are variations in teachers' ability, class sizes, curricula, instructional facilities and materials, all of which affect eh educational product, the pupil. Figures do not reflect these significant variables not do they indicated the extent to which the declining purchasing power of the dollar accounts for higher expenditures" (Jan 1953, p2) History of State General Aid Formula (January 1965, p2) "The basis for distributing State general aid to help towns and cities finance the current expenses of public schools has undergone major changes since school year 1944-45. That year, the State's general aid was distributed thorugh a variety of 17 grants. In school year 1945-46, an additional grant [Public Law 183]was provided for the purposses of enabling all towns and cities to bring school expenditures up to a required 'minimum program' of \$100 per pupil." "A revision of the State aid laws in 1947 abolished the 17 grants and replaced them with a single grant, the formula for which constitutes the basis of distributing aid from 1947-48 through 1952-53. In 1947-48, the 'minimum program' to qulaify for State general aid was increased to \$140 per pupl. The 1953 Gneeral Assemb added an across-the-board grant of \$4 per pupil for 1953-54 and 1954-55. The grant per pupil was revised upward by the 1955 General Assembly, effective for teh school years 1955-56 and 1956-57. In 1956-57 the required 'minimum program' was increased to \$200 per pupil. Another upward revision of the grant formula was approved in 1957, effective for the years 1957-58 through 1960-61. The 1961 Gen Assemb again revised the grant formula upward for school years 1961-62 and 1962-63, and raised the required 'minimum program' to \$250 per pupil in 1961-62 and \$300 per pupil in 1962-63." "Increases in the grant formula approved by the 1963 Gen Assemb were effective in school year 1963-64. However, the 1963 Gen Assemb did not reenact the 'minimum program' aspect of the formula. Thus, towns did not need to spend a minimal amount per pupil in school year 1963-64 in order to qualify for their full portions of State general aid."

Formerly distributed among towns within specified population and tax receipt ranges, the grantt is now made to all towns transporting elem school pupils, with the STate reimbursing them for hal fthe cost up to a limit of \$20 per pupil. As a result, total State grants to towns for transportation (page 39) have increased sharply, from \$1464k in 1960-61 to \$2538k in 1961-62" Jan 1964 p1 1963 Gen Assemb revised state formula aid [officially, Assistance to Towns for Educational Purposes] [*\$5 increase for all ranges ABOVE (eg \$161 becomes \$166) PLUS \$3 increase for growth subsidy*] "Plus \$20 per pupil in ADM in excess of ADM of the ninth prior year" Also, no minimum level required for general state ed aid Jan 1966 p1 Gen Assemb revised state formula aid effective 1965-66 [*flattens ranges and boosts each about \$20-25*] 2nd 100 pupils  \$175 per pupil 5th 100 pupils  \$ 150 per pupil Each pupil in excess of 600  \$120 per pupil PLUS \$20 per pupil in ADM in excess of ADM of the ninth prior year Jan 1967 p1 Note language: "A growth grant, which provides additional State aid for the increase in pupils over a nine-year period, has been part of the general aid formula since 1957-58" new format adds "Per Cent Distribution of Total Expenses" Jan 1968, p1 Gen Assemb revised state formula aid effective 1965-66 [*continues to flatten ranges,with greatest boost for larger districts (up from \$120 to \$150 for each additional pupil over first 600)*] 2nd 100 pupils  \$180 per pupil 4th 100 pupils  \$150 per pupil PLUS Growth Grant: \$20 per pupil in ADM in excess of ADM of the ninth prior year Jan 1970, p1 Gen Assemb revised state formula effective 1969-70 [*flat rate of \$200 per pupil, and elimination of the Growth Grant, therefore shifting greater proportion of aid to large city districts*] \$200 per pupil "A growth grant, based on the increase in pupils over a nine-year period provided additional State aid and was part of the general aid formula from 1957-58 through 1968-69." new format for reporting data Because of 1969 legislation removing interest on school bonds from the definition of Net Current Expenses, only data for pupils, operating expenses, state gen and special aid are exactly comparable with previous years. Beginning this year, "total expenses" includes Operating Expenses as well as debt service (principal AND interest on school bonds), equipment, and transportation costs. Last year, principal on school bonds and equipment costs were not reported under Total Expenses. [*"Net Current Expenses" is used synonymously with "Operating Expenses" *] Jan 1971, p1 CAUTIONARY NOTE "In 1969-70 many towns received, for the first time, lump-sum public school building grants from teh State under Public Act 751" [included in tables under "state aid for new schools and transportation", but not separated out]. ... This aid, used in most instances to pay off short-term borrowing in school building funds, sharply increased Debt Service Payments and, consequently, Total Expenses." p3 Jan 1972, p1 Gen Assemb revises gen aid effective 1971-72 to flat rate of \$210 per pupil START TAKING NOTES AGAIN WITH JAN 1973 ****},

Both groups, along with other Project Concern participants, were traced. In 1982, some 700 students and their parents were surveyed, after they had finished secondary school. It was concluded that attending suburban schools reduced high school dropout rates, increased adult contacts with whites socially, and increased the number of blacks choosing to live in interracial housing. Male participants had fewer difficulties with police, perceived less discrimination in colleges and in employment, and were more likely to succeed in college.

  abstract = {author's web summary: http://www.dartmouth.edu/\textasciitilde{}wfischel/ Unlike most other economists, I have relied primarily on sole-author books to develop my scholarship. Their common theme is local government. “The Economics of Zoning Laws” (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985) argued that zoning is the product of rational, if not always admirable, economic calculation by voters in American municipalities. As Dick Babcock, the late dean of practicing land-use lawyers, used to say, nobody loves zoning but the people. “Regulatory Takings” (Harvard University Press, 1995) explored the constitutional ways by which the excesses of zoning might be curbed without infringing excessively on local governance. A special interest during this phase of my career were follow-ups on regulatory takings cases to see what happened afterwards, as in the photographic essays (Lucas Essay) (Lucas Update) on Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992). A rethinking of regulatory takings is in my 2007 investigation of the facts of Miller v. Schoene, the case of the cedar trees that made apples go bad. It has made me less optimistic about the doctrine’s viability.},

Research results concerning the effectiveness of magnet schools are mixed. Currently, many large urban school districts are at the crossroads of sweeping changes in the use of magnet schools as a means to racial desegregation, with a series of major federal court rulings repudiating district attempts to maintain race-conscious admission policies to promote racial diversity in these schools.},

  abstract = {Book Description: In this genial and challenging overview of endless debates over school reform, Rick Hess shows that even bitter opponents in debates about how to improve schools agree on much more than they realize—and that much of it must change radically. Cutting through the tangled thickets of right- and left-wing dogma, he clears the ground for transformation of the American school system.  Whatever they think of school vouchers or charter schools, teacher merit pay or bilingual education, most educators and advocates take many other things for granted. The one-teacher–one-classroom model. The professional full-time teacher. Students grouped in age-defined grades. The nine-month calendar. Top-down local district control. All were innovative and exciting—in the nineteenth century. As Hess shows, the system hasn’t changed since most Americans lived on farms and in villages, since school taught you to read, write, and do arithmetic, and since only an elite went to high school, let alone college. Arguing that a fundamentally nineteenth century system can’t be right for a twenty-first century world, Hess suggests that uniformity gets in the way of quality, and urges us to create a much wider variety of schools, to meet a greater range of needs for different kinds of talents, needed by a vastly more complex and demanding society.

Researchershave consistently argued that HOLC caused redlining and disinvestmentin U.S. cities by sharing its color-coded maps. Geographic informationsystems and spatial statistical models were used to analyze address-level mortgage data from Philadelphia to determine ifareas with worse grades actually had less access to residentialmortgage credit as a result. Findings indicate that the gradeson HOLC's map do not explain differences in lending patternswith the exception of interest rates, which were higher in areascolored red. Archival material and journal articles from the1930s also reveal that lenders were avoiding areas colored redbefore HOLC made its maps, that HOLC's maps were not widelydistributed, and that lenders had other sources of informationabout real estate risk levels."},

And both business and neighborhood interests ultimately sought political and governmental solutions to their problems. The result was an era of ghetto maintenance and expansion that was designed, in large part, to meet the needs of the contending white factions. Out of the chaos emerged the second ghetto, an entity now distinguished by government support and sanction" pxiii about "ethnics": To say that some fought racial succession and valued stable, centrally located urban neighborhood is nto to claim that all did. Although the numbers are impossible to determine, it seems certain that hte vast majority of the descendants of both the 'old' and 'new' immigrations became assimilated and mobile, joined the post-World War II trek to the suburbs, and never bothered to look back..... [but] if the inner-city "ethnics" who were concerned about communal stability and neighborhood solidarity were staistically insignificant compared with their more assimilated counterparts (and this is only a supposition), their impact on postwar public policy in Chicago was considerable." pxiii Ch1 The second ghetto and the dynamics of neighborhood change contrast between interracial violence of 1919 "communal" riot with white mobs attacking black ghettos vs property damage of 1968 "commodity" riot after King's assassination path was not ineviatable, but determined by degree of governmental intervention, but expansion of second ghetto was sanctioned and supported by govt - siting of public housing projects  - HOLC and FHA indirectly furthered seg by support white mid-class sub flight late 1930s Ida B Wells homes supported by black press, despite segregation, due to dire need for decent housing; with many black trade workers, yet by 1943 black Chicagoans protested National Housing Agency dference to local restrictive covenants push-pull factors of second migration, leading to severe housing shortage amid rise of WWII defense industry diverted away from construction "the coincidence of plentiful jobs and scarce housing" p20 crisis grew worse after WWII; dilapidated construction 1950s suburban exodus reshaped central city "As the more well-to-do whites were selectively drained from Chicago's core, vacancies began to appear around the Black Belt.

Once new construction began, however, those same forces became an overwhelmingly powerful engine for change. With an increase in housing alternatives for whites, the economic forces of the racial housing market all worked for, rather than against, racial succession. The one remaining element upholding the old accommodation -- restrictive covenants -- proved unequal to the task of maintaining neighborhood stability." p29 "Five years before the Supreme Court finally rendered all resitrictive covenants unenforceable (Shelley v Kraemer, 1948), Judge Samuel Heller regularly refused to uphold them in Chicago's Municipal Court" p30; many white property owners violated them and elected to fill vacant units with blacks instead p30 real estate speculators (aka "block busters" or "panic peddlers")who bridged the dual black-white housing markets enabled reluctant whites in transition areas to sell property to other whites, which in turn would be sold to blacks who could not obtain regular financing from white institutions p31 installment land contracts for home purchases; higher rents in apartments; buyers urged to take on roomers to help pay high rates landlords quickly making slums out of middle-class areas; blacks urged Urban League to take stand but "The pressures of the marketplace, however, were too great" p33 enforcement of housing codes not actively done in Chicago 1940s-50s p34 real estate speculators unscrupulous block-busting tactics "But the panic that often ensued was not the sole product of these real estate mavericks. In her study of Chicago realtors, Rose Helper found varying degrees of 'respectablity' among them. Some of the more proper firms refused to sell property to blacks until 50\% or more of the area had 'gone'. ... Once the 'disreputable' dealer had done his job, the more 'respectable' flocked to do business in transition neighborhoods where their own particular 'black threshold' had been inevitably met'." p34-35 working and lower-middle-class whites "caught in this economic squeeze" with "nowhere to go"... "a contemporary South Side study of attitudes toward racial succession found that among lower status whites it was the fear that they would be dispossessed that inspired the most antiblack sentiment" p35; cannot compete against middle-class blacks for housing overcrowded, dilapidated outcomes led most whites to infer that black inmigration led to physical deterioration; white reactions ranged from violence/arson to reshaping environment with 'urban planning' p36; Southside Planning Assocation created 1939 to design "ingenious ways of preventing Negroes from moving into the area"; SPA bought property back from blacks moving in p37; SPA involved in passage of IL Redev Act of 1941 to demolish black settlement and move them to all-black suburb (but not accomplished)Ch2 An era of hidden violence in contrast to 1919 riot over labor-racial strife, 1947 riot period over shift in racial territory and housing, which later gave way to 1950s battles over use of community facilities Ch3 Friends, neighbors, and rioters analysis of those arrested in riots, residential proximity to riot area; local struggles over turf; also ethnicity, occ status, etc Ch4 The Loop versus teh slums: downtown strikes back in response to expansion of ghetto and central city deterioration, large downtown institutions "used their combined economic resources and political influence to produce a redevelopment and urban renewal program designed to gurantee their continued prosperity"; paralle reaction to white ethnic working class, but less violent p100 private interests used public policy (redevelopment acts of 1947, 1953) to protect themselves "Although humanistic concern for the quality of life in [Loop] areas was often expressed, simple economics governed the Loop's devotion to its hinterland. Chicago's gbusiness elite clearly envisaged a postware building boom ion the city's periphery, the flight of the middle class, and the insulation of State Street from its 'normal market'. They subsequently tried to counter the forces promoting decentralization thorugh the 'complet rehabiltation of the center of the city'.

The imputation of brotherhood with the ethnic, working-class rock throwers would have been more than they could bear. Yet, there was just such a consensus. Each of the various white groups or interests agreed on the fundamental undesirability of racial succession. Each of them were, for their own reasons, unable or unwilling to flee the city, and each believed that the profcess ahd to be controlled to project their self [171] defed interests. There was certainly wide divergence int eh means deemed acceptable to manage succession, but th Hypde Park proclivity for sending building inspectors rather than debris into the homes of new black residents stemmed from the same fears that called forth crowds elsewhere.... Although the rhetoric of integration was in sharp contrast tothe virulent racist diatribes that were offered in some quarters, the justification given for actions tkane reveal the differences among the various white groups to be more in the vehemence of language and the sophistication of the resistance than in fundamental assumptions." p171-72 acculturation theory and generalizing of all blacks author identifies "merging of the 'ethnics' ". .. "to assert their 'whiteness,' their bade of rank and status in teir adopted home" p186 neighborhood newspapers: "Indeed, the whites around Trumbull Park constucted their own immigrant/black analogy,k which adhered more closely to their own perspective. Nobody was 'poorer' than the European immigrants, the Bulletin claimed, and yet their accomplishments were achieved without governmetn aid; they 'just worked like hell [186 end] and saved for a rainy day'. Let the blacks, it was concluded, do the same." p186-87 opponents to black neighbors were "welded together by an intense race consciousness. The South Deering Bulletin submerged nationality and stated the case plainty: 'White people built this area [and] we want no part of this race mixing..Race pride has come to the fore as a new set of values'." p187 "Significantly, this deep concern for 'white,' not 'ethnic,' rights was often heard in taverns where Polish remained the primary language." p187 Ch7 Making the second ghetto downtown business interests exerted stronger power through redevelopment public policy (for their private interests) than did white ethnic working-class neighborhood groups, which did exert limited pressure (through violent riots) on public orgs like Chicago Housing Authority to segregate neighborhoods; yet both white groups had more power than Chicago blacks, locked out of decision-making processEpilogue: Chicago and the nation},

This study situates school choice within one metropolitan region, Denver, and examines the ways in which choice patterns relate to existing patterns of stratification between school districts. This regional focus offers insight into the patterns of interdistrict choice and the influence these patterns have on equity within a metropolitan region. Findings from this study indicate that relatively higher income students were more likely to take advantage of interdistrict choice, and that choice was more often used by students to exit from a less advantaged context (as measured by socioeconomic status) to a relatively more advantaged one. The article concludes with recommendations for policymakers in designing more equity-minded choice policies."},

Using transcripts from three focus discussion groups, personal interviews, and a student forum, the authors present the voices and perspectives of students and parents who are crossing these boundaries, as well as the voices of educators they meet on the other side. A variety of issuesandconcerns emerge fromthe conversations that raise questions about the efficacy of OpenChoice and busing, and their potential impact on student achievement.We argue that crossing boundaries of race, class, and culture requires a long-term commitment to fundamental social change and consistent efforts to raise the racial consciousness of educators through a statewide overhaul of professional development, specifically in the area of multicultural diversity training." based on ACES Open Choice, not CREC Open Choice},

  abstract = {"America has become a nation of suburbs. Confronting the popular image of suburbia as simply a refuge for affluent whites, The New Suburban History rejects the stereotypes of a conformist and conflict-free suburbia. The seemingly calm streets of suburbia were, in fact, battlegrounds over race, class, and politics. With this collection, Kevin Kruse and Thomas Sugrue argue that suburbia must be understood as a central factor in the modern American experience.  Kruse and Sugrue here collect ten essays—augmented by their provocative introduction—that challenge our understanding of suburbia. Drawing from original research on suburbs across the country, the contributors recast important political and social issues in the context of suburbanization. Their essays reveal the role suburbs have played in the transformation of American liberalism and conservatism; the contentious politics of race, class, and ethnicity; and debates about the environment, land use, and taxation. The contributors move the history of African Americans, Latinos, Asians, and blue-collar workers from the margins to the mainstream of suburban history. From this broad perspective, these innovative historians explore the way suburbs affect—and are affected by—central cities, competing suburbs, and entire regions. The results, they show, are far-reaching: the emergence of a suburban America has reshaped national politics, fostered new social movements, and remade the American landscape. The New Suburban History offers nothing less than a new American history—one that claims the nation cannot be fully understood without a history of American suburbs at its very center."

  abstract = {see also full volume obtained digital draft from author ABSTRACT: Although there are many, often competing, justifications for school choice, almost all are premised on the notion that parents are to be empowered to select the best schools for their children. While this assumption derives from economic theory, it too often devolves into an ideological debate regarding whether or not parents are able to choose a school in their child’s best interests. This analysis examines two types of arguments that parents are necessarily the most effective advocates for their children’s educational interests: first, a philosophical contention that parents are necessarily best positioned to exercise primary responsibility over their children’s education; and secondly, an empirical claim that parents choose schools based on evidence of academic quality. The analysis finds each of these claims to be problematic in light of evidence on the dynamics of school choice in the real-world context. Instead of debating whether or not parents can choose the best schools, I argue that the appropriate question is whether the requisite knowledge or information is widely available and equitably distributed through mechanisms of choice and competition. To that end, I introduce a framework for considering types of information that could be employed in selecting a school. A short empirical exercise demonstrates that more useful types of information are least likely to be available to parents.},

Data were obtained from the Connecticut State Department of Education, three of the state's Regional Educational Service Centers, and interviews with education officials. The results indicate that, from the state's viewpoint, desegregation programs are small because they are part of an overall, gradual strategy and are designed to fit within the legal limitations on desegregation remedies posed by recent federal court decisions. However, from the Sheff plaintiffs' viewpoint, the small size of the programs shows that state policymakers lack any real will to exercise leadership on school integration. It is concluded that the overall effect of the state's voluntary desegregation policies has been to subsidize further racial isolation in the inner cities and minimal diversity in the suburbs."

This initiative assesses access to neighborhoods of opportunity in state of Connecticut.
Connecticut Fair Housing Center (CHFC) partnered with Kirwan Institute to perform research that leads to better understanding of how to support and promote inclusive, diverse communities of choice. CHFC looked to our work in the area of opportunity mapping in order to identify how fair housing can become more of an intervention point for marginalized communities across the state. Access to good education, affordable housing, quality of health care, employment and open space was assessed to create maps showing spatial distribution of opportunity in the state. The maps and findings were presented to our clients and stakeholders in Connecticut on Nov. 12, 2009.},

  abstract = {Book Description: How is it that, half a century after Brown v. Board of Education, educational opportunities remain so unequal for black and white students, not to mention poor and wealthy ones? In his important new book, Five Miles Away, A World Apart, James E. Ryan answers this question by tracing the fortunes of two schools in Richmond, Virginia--one in the city and the other in the suburbs. Ryan shows how court rulings in the 1970s, limiting the scope of desegregation, laid the groundwork for the sharp disparities between urban and suburban public schools that persist to this day. The Supreme Court, in accord with the wishes of the Nixon administration, allowed the suburbs to lock nonresidents out of their school systems. City schools, whose student bodies were becoming increasingly poor and black, simply received more funding, a measure that has proven largely ineffective, while the independence (and superiority) of suburban schools remained sacrosanct. Weaving together court opinions, social science research, and compelling interviews with students, teachers, and principals, Ryan explains why all the major education reforms since the 1970s--including school finance litigation, school choice, and the No Child Left Behind Act--have failed to bridge the gap between urban and suburban schools and have unintentionally entrenched segregation by race and class. As long as that segregation continues, Ryan forcefully argues, so too will educational inequality. Ryan closes by suggesting innovative ways to promote school integration, which would take advantage of unprecedented demographic shifts and an embrace of diversity among young adults. Exhaustively researched and elegantly written by one of the nation's leading education law scholars, Five Miles Away, A World Apart ties together, like no other book, a half-century's worth of education law and politics into a coherent, if disturbing, whole. It will be of interest to anyone who has ever wondered why our schools are so unequal and whether there is anything to be done about it.},

The statement refers to whites and blacks, but does not deal with racial groups as part of a planned strategy: 'Many...people have been discouraged from buying here by real estate agents who warned prospective white families that this area will be the nexxt ghetto. Many Negro families ahve contacted us to inquire whethr or not the area is in fact becomgin a ghetto and to inquire how the area would react to their living here' (News, May 1968)" p194-95 "The same inability to deal with a specific strategy for integration maintenance can be seen in a housing policy statement developed in November 1969"; BHCA Nov 1969 housing doc stresses "open occupancy" at first, then specific tactic for maintaining "the integrated quality of life in the neighborhood. This means that e will work to interest white families in living in the area...It is easy to misinterpret such a statement to say that it is opposed to open housing. In fact, the statement is an attempt to counteract the well-documented flight of white families out of the city, especially from area that are integrated. If we want to maintain an open neighborhood, it must be open to all in fact, not just in theory. Affirmative action is required to attrac and retain white families to the area generally, whiel at the same time we support open housing in every individual sale or rental." p195 author's analysis: document did not emphasize neighborhood quality issues or need for regional open housing for blacks; "Instead, the Blue Hills area continued to be the only hospitable neighborhood in the city for upwardly mobilie blacks, and their pent-up demand for housing resulted in continuing racial concentration inthe Blue Hills neighborhood." p196 controversy in BH Housing Services Corp over white-priority focus; see Bolduc 1976 thesis; HT 19 June 1971 editorial; sold 23 homes to whites form suburban areas; when "outspoken" BHCA members asked for "a clarificaiton of the corporation's racial policy" and questioned whether white preferences was racist, shareholders withdrew support and corporation dissolved p197 BHCA housing cmte continued monitoring and legal actions against real estate activities:  \#1) block-busting complaint filed with HUD on 11 Nov 1971, then ref to CT Comm on Human Rights and Opportunities, then filed in Federal district court; "When the agent gave up his real estate license, the court declared the case moot. It was the first use of fair housing law in the State of CT (letter from attorney to HUD, 5 June 1972)" \#2) racial-steering suit brought by Education/Instruccion (EI) "still another splinter group formed in 1971 by formerly active BHCA members and residents. EI was a general civil rights group that conducted educational research"p 197; housing test cases; lawsuit filed (with BHCA as one of several plaintiffs) in 1973-74 against 8 real estate firms; charges filed with US Dept of Justice 1974; investigated by FBI; denied by realtors (HC 21 Feb 1974); "A consent decree was issued in 1975, which required the companies to engage in fair housing practices and inform their staffs of provisioins of fair housing law. No admission of guilt was needed for the decree by Dept of Justice." p198 "Bob Harris, the former director of EI, a former BHCA member and Blue Hills resident and in 1984 one of the few remaining whites, said the Hartford newspapers woudl not print the story when first infomred of the findings, becuase 'they had so much money in real estate advertising' it would be bad for business. Finally, he said: 'We ended up going to Associated Press and it went out through the AP wires and came back in with theAP heading and was printed in both papers the same morning to protect them. That's how sad the situation had become'. He also complained that the State Human Rights Commission, formed to receive and act on discrimination complaints, was ineffective" p198 [backed up 18 months] BHCA housing cmte stopped functions 1972 "after several former BHCA leaders formed Urban Edge as a nonprofit fair housing real estate company p198 BHCA and Education "Even more vital and important than the early housing commitee was BHCA's education committee"; focus on school quality, but dwindled after 1973; "By this time the Blue Hills shcools were almost totally black" p198 "The BHCA's overrriding concern with education and the public schools was linked to the association's goal of preservation of a high-quality racially integrated neighborhood. Since the schools were such a vitally important neighborhood facility, association leaders belived it essential to have high-quality education in its neighborhood schools. the earliest reputation of BHCA was as a school-oriented organization -- "just a big PTA" -- as minutes of a 1969 board meeting reveal (Bolduc 1976: 137)" p199 author's analysis: "Prevention of impaction [85\% black in 1980] might have occurred in 1971 if the housing corporation had been encouraged to continue its policy of affirmative marketing... What might have succeeded in 1971 was a well-coordinated effort to recruit whites to the Blue Hills neighborhood at the same time that blacks were given expanded housing choices elsewhere. This could have been done in conjunction with the CT Housing investment Fund, which was heavily funded to assist blacks in moving to the suburbs. Unfortunately, CHIF also had internal problems and coflicts, andeventually turned its focus to rental counseling,k energy conservation, and the rehabilitation of existing units. Though its active couseling and mortgage assitance efforts helped over 1,900 minority families move to the suburbs throughout the state of CT, this died not help the Blue Hills area." p203 "But there was no ongoing fair housing problem of combating racial discrimiation in the housing market. The two legal suits filed in the early 1970s were a mere ripple in the tide of housing discrimination" p204 author cites four external forces that acted against BHCA neighborhood organization (p. 204): 1) urban renewal and land clearance in downtown Hartford that displaced thousands of minorities 2) racial discrimination in housing and mortgage markets that resulted in Northend racial concentration 3) public housing location --"Two massive public housing projects bordered the Blue Hills area, and their children were included in the Blue Hills neighborhood schools." 4) school racial imbalance -- "city efforts at desegregation occurring too late and too little to avert racial impaction of the Blue Hills schools" Why did BHCA decline? "One logical explanation for this might be that hte neighborhood became so overwhelmingly black, the original goal was then impossible to attain, and so there was no cause left to work for. but that is too simple. If we lok at other neighborhood stabilization organization we find that even when the neighborhood became predominantly black, the organization continued with a secondary goal of neighorhood maintenance and improvement -- a perfectly respectable second aim for a neighborhood group. Why didn't BHCA do this?  One difference between BHCA an the orther movement orgs studied is that this was the only organization that did not begin with the stated goal of integration maintenance. by the time new leaders and members openly acclaimed that goal in 1965, the neighborhood was already almost half-black, and the schools there were predominantly black." p209  [*author would be more direct if she stated that BHCA's original purpose was to prevent blacks from moving into neighborhood, as she quoted Bob Harris earlier*]  "Permost most important as a reason for burnout was the bitter internal conflict over affirmative marketing tactics, which further weakened the organization and caused the spin-offs of two other organizations." p210 Bob Harris criticizes Project Concern for drawing "highest quality black kids" away from neighborhood schools, p211 An older white couple, still iving in Blue Hills, on Weaver HS:  "I think that more recently people moved [away] because of the schools. The high school was once awfully good and it was predominantly white when it was built. After we moved here, white attendance just slid off the map... Very bad -- for white children" p212 also, HPS board did not adopt 1965 Harvard plan due to state funding concerns; HPS board "spent the next ten yeras implementing piecemeal segments of the plan, avoiding others, and circumventing still others" [cites Champ 1975, Brayfield 1975] p212 BHCA acronym taken over by Blue Hills Citizen Action, a group with paid organizers, not neighborhood volunteers now Blue Hills is stablizing low-middle-class black community, one of most influential political communities in the city, p213 author's final postscript notes that BHCA has been revived, and she is sending materials to new director [**remember that most names are pseudonyms*] Still looking for these sources: [not in WorldCat; trying to contact Saltman, currrent BHCA]: Thomas Champ, "Compromised Efforts at Desegregation."

  abstract = {summary: "Education has witnessed a broad movement to reduce the central role of school districts in the administration of schools by providing individual schools with greater independence in making educational decisions.  In noted cases, school districts have shifted responsibilities for budgetary allocation, choice of personnel, instructional strategies, curriculum, accountability, and professional development to school sites from central headquarters.  In other cases, they have converted schools from district-management to charter schools and schools that are contracted out to for-profit educational management organizations, universities, and other institutional sponsors.  In some school districts, such as New Orleans, there is an initiative to establish choice districts in which the goal is to minimize or even eliminate the district role and let schools compete for students in an educational marketplace. This paper examines the dynamics of two cases that have moved in this direction.  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada was one of the earliest of the larger school districts (76,000 students) to decentralize its operations some 30 years ago.  This substantial experience allows an inquiry into which functions have been successfully handled by schools and which have remained the responsibility of the school district, in some cases having been transformed by the district to accommodate school autonomy.  In the second case a group of six charter schools in Florida has been developed into a charter "district" under the official aegis of a County School District. Perhaps, surprisingly, many of the traditional roles of the sponsoring school districts have been retained and even strengthened to support the shift of major educational decisions to individual school sites."},

  abstract = {Excerpts on Hartford or Connecticut:

 "With the establishment of new industries to meet the needs of the war, the erection of munitions plants for the manufacture of war materials and the enlargement of already existing industries to meet the abnormally large demand for materials here and in Europe, there came a shifting in the existing labor supply in the North. There was a rush to the higher paid positions in the munitions plants. This, together with the advancement of the white men to higher positions nearly depleted the ranks of common labor. The companies employing foreign labor for railroad construction work, and in the steel mills of Pennsylvania, the tobacco fields of Connecticut, the packing houses, foundries and automobile plants of the Northwest, found it imperative to seek for labor in home fields. The Department of Labor, in the effort to relieve this shortage, through its employment service, at first assisted the migration northward. It later withdrew its assistance when its attention was called to the growing magnitude of the movement and its possible effect on the South. Deserted by the Department of Labor, certain northern employers undertook to translate their desire into action in 1915, when the anxieties of the New England tobacco planters were felt in the New York labor market. These planters at first rushed to New York and promiscuously gathered up 200 girls of the worst type, who straightway proceeded to demoralize Hartford. The blunder was speedily detected and the employers came back to New York, seeking some agency which might assist them in the solution of their problem. Importuned for help, the National League on Urban Conditions among Negroes supplied these planters with respectable southern blacks who met this unusual demand for labor in Connecticut. Later, moreover, it appeared that on the threshold of an unusually promising year the Poles, Lithuanians and Czechs, formerly employed in the fields, were dwindling in number and there was not at hand the usual supply from which their workers were recruited. A large number of these foreigners had been called back to their fatherland to engage in the World War. In January of 1916, therefore, the tobacco growers of Connecticut met in conference to give this question serious consideration. Mr. Floyd, the Manager of the Continental Tobacco Corporation, offered a solution for this difficult problem through the further importation of negro labor. The response to this suggestion was not immediate, because New England had never had large experience with the negro labor. An intense interest in the experiment, however, was aroused through a number of men with connections in the South. It was decided that the National League on Urban Conditions among Negroes, with headquarters in New York City, should further assist in securing laborers. Because of the seasonal character of the work, an effort was made to get students from the southern schools by advancing transportation. The "New York News," a negro weekly, says of this conference: '...Thus was born, right in the heart of Yankee Land, the first significant move to supplant foreign labor with native labor, a step which has resulted in one of the biggest upheavals in the North incident to the European war, which has already been a boon to the colored American, improving his economic status and putting thousands of dollars into his pockets.' .....The North may well be divided according to the two main lines followed by the migrants in leaving the South. The South and middle Atlantic States sent the majority of their migrants directly up the Atlantic coast while the south central States fed the Northwest. There is of course, no hard line of separation for these two streams. Laborers were sought in fields most accessible to the centers of industry, but individual choice as displayed in the extent of voluntary migration carried them everywhere. The New England States, which were probably the first to attract this labor, were Connecticut and Massachusetts. The tobacco fields of Connecticut with Hartford as a center received the first negro laborers as mentioned above. Before a year had passed there were over 3,000 southern Negroes in the city of Hartford. ...The eastern cities which made efforts through various means to augment their labor supply were Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Newark, New York City and Hartford. It is manifestly impossible to get reliable figures on the volume of increase in the negro population of any of these cities. All that is available is in the form of estimates which can not be too confidently relied upon. Estimates based on the average number of arrivals from the South per day, the increase in the school population and the opinions of social agencies which have engaged themselves in adjusting to their new homes appear to agree in the main."

"Hartford was one of the industrial centers to which large numbers of the migrating Negroes went. The housing problem became acute and the chief efforts of those endeavoring to better the conditions of migrants was along this line. Religious, civic and commercial bodies gave attention to the amelioration of this problem. The problem of housing Negroes who were coming in greater numbers each year to Hartford was taken up briefly by speakers at the 128th annual meeting of the [end page 141] Hartford Baptist Association at the Shiloh Baptist Church. It was decided to bring the housing problem before the attention of the Chamber of Commerce, which, it was said, some time before had appointed a committee to investigate it. Negroes complained that they were obliged to pay higher rent than white folks and that they were obliged by landlords to live together in cramped quarters that were, by reason of the crowding, unsanitary. They said also that the living of several families almost as one family leads to a breaking down of the moral and religious ideals. Conditions in Hartford resulting from the bringing of more than 2,500 Negroes from the South were discussed at the fall meeting of the Confidential Exchange with a view to preparing for these new arrivals. At the June, 1917, meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, a committee was appointed from that body to investigate housing conditions and to cooperate with other agencies in improving them. The committee met frequently through the summer with the housing committee of the Civic Club, in an endeavor to ascertain the facts bearing upon the present situation. It had before it leading colored citizens, ministers, business men and industrial workers, some of whom have lived here for years and others who have recently arrived from the South. It was discovered that there was, at that time, plenty of work and at good wages, but the universal complaint was the lack of homes suitable for proper living and the extortionate prices asked for rents. Negroes in Hartford were suffering from the cupidity of landlords. They were obliged to live in poor tenements and under unhealthful conditions because accommodations of another class were withheld from them. For such inferior accommodations they were charged outrageous rents, because selfish property owners knowing that Negroes must live charged all the traffic would bear. Partial relief was obtained from the immediate need by the purchase of buildings already erected, and homes for them were later built. It appeared that for the first time in many years Hartford had a race problem on its hands." [end p 142]

Abstract: Using Hartford Public High School as a case study, this article analyses how women teachers in the nineteenth century used their ties to the community and their success in the classroom to influence the decision-making structure of a co-educational institution. While women teachers are not usually considered a powerful constituency, Hartford Public High School affords a unique opportunity to re-evaluate the meaning of educational politics from a gendered perspective. Based on manuscript sources for teachers who worked at the school, this examination reveals not only the gendered allocation of power in nineteenth-century high schools, but also the active role of committed women teachers in contesting that power.},

  abstract = {The top-down nature of the Interstate Highway Act meant that policymakers often proposed highways without taking into account the potential spatial and “placial” consequences of how and where freeways, exits, and interchanges were and were not built. As such, there are several pieces in the National Highway System – the term used for the combination of Interstates highways and U.S. routes – that cut across existing grains within urban landscapes. As a result, some urban scholars have stated that the Federal-Aid Highway Act has been the most harmful federal policy aimed at American cities. The highway’s attack on urban areas was detrimental in two important manners. First, it allowed for middle-class whites to flee from declining urban cores to homogeneous suburban communities outside of the central city’s tax base. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, freeways became concrete barriers that divided cities, destroyed existing neighborhoods and brought tremendous amounts of auditory, visual and environmental pollution to urban communities.},

After politicians and lobbyists spent the spring building the case that teachers were failing to do more than seek protection from unions, there was much self-congratulatory sentiment following yesterday’s announcement from the State Department of Education that CMT/CAPT scores had improved. Though Governor Malloy’s “education reform legislation” was not passed until months after students had filled out bubble sheets to prove they were learning, that fact has not prevented some from attributing the gains to the so-called reform movement.

In Hartford, gains did not occur across the board; in fact, the total percentage of third graders proficient in reading actually decreased slightly: in 2011, 51.5\% were proficient, but in 2012, the number dropped to 50\%},

Although overall enrollment in the Connecticut schools has declined over the past five years, the number of children identified as having severe learning disabilities who took the Skills Checklist rose by almost 32 percent, or 900 students.

Similarly, the number of students who took the Modified Assessments in the past two years -- when the federal goverment started allowing this option -- rose by 7 percent, or more than 1,300 students.

  abstract = {Slavery in the South has been documented in volumes ranging from exhaustive histories to bestselling novels. But the North's profit from---indeed, dependence on---slavery has mostly been a shameful and well-kept secret ... until now. In this startling and superbly researched new book, three veteran New England journalists demythologize the region of America know for tolerance and liberation, revealing a place where thousands of people were held in bondage and slavery was both an economic dynamo and a necessary way of life.   Complicity reveals the cruel truth about the Triangle Trade of molasses, rum, and slaves that lucratively linked the North to the West Indies and Africa; discloses the reality of Northern empires built on profits from rum, cotton, and ivory---and run, in some cases, by abolitionists; and exposes the thousand-acre plantations that existed in towns such as Salem, Connecticut. Here, too, are eye-opening accounts of the individuals who profited directly from slavery far from the Mason-Dixon line---including Nathaniel Gordon of Maine, the only slave trader sentenced to die in the United States, who even as an inmate of New York's infamous Tombs prison was supported by a shockingly large percentage of the city; Patty Cannon, whose brutal gang kidnapped free blacks from Northern states and sold them into slavery; and the Philadelphia doctor Samuel Morton, eminent in the ninteenth-century field of "race science," which purported to prove the inferiority of African-born black people.   Culled from long-ignored documents and reports---and bolstered by rarely seen photos, publications, maps, and period drawings---Complicity is a fascinating and sobering work that actually does what so many books pretend to do: shed light on America's past. Expanded from the celebrated Hartford Courant special report that the Connecticut Department of Education sent to every middle school and high school in the state (the original work is required readings in many college classrooms,) this new book is sure to become a must-read reference everywhere.},

  abstract = {In this 2011 video interview with transcript, Simon Bernstein (born 1913) primarily describes his role regarding two Connecticut civil rights issues: restrictive covenants and public education equality. As a lawyer and Hartford alderman in 1947, he publicly challenged racially restrictive covenants in property deeds. In 1950, he and his family moved to suburban Bloomfield, CT, where he served on the local board of education. In 1965, as a delegate to the Connecticut Constitutional Convention, he authored an amendment that guaranteed a free public education to every child, which laid the legal foundation for the 1970s Horton v. Meskill school finance cases, the 1989 Sheff v O'Neill school desegregation lawsuit, and the Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc. v Rell ruling in 2010. In addition, he discusses his relationships with Democratic Party chairman John Bailey, Governor Abraham Ribicoff, Hartford Mayor Thomas Spellacy, and his later role as a judge. Finally, he recalls memories of growing up as a Jewish boy in Hartford's Frog Hollow neighborhood and attending nearby Trinity College, where he graduated with the Class of 1933.},

The median wage, where half earn more and half less, rose by just 2.4 percent, to \$811 a week, and the 10th-percentile wage was flat at \$361 a week, in 2011 dollars.},

Initially, the BOE was hesitant to speak up; one member of the school board said that because the Superintendent is female, they had tiptoed around in an effort to be sensitive to potential gender dynamics issues.

That free pass, however, has been tossed.

The Board of Education is recommending that Dr. Kishimoto “pursue services offered for additional professional development,” to address areas in which she received low grades from the board in her annual performance evaluation.

In the area of relations with the board, she earned the unsatisfactory grade of a 1.6 out of 5. They said the training provided for new board members in 2012 was weak and inadequate attention was given to this transition.},

By mandating their appraisal analysis as a prerequisite for membership into the federal banking system, the FHLBB established unified national lending standards designed to evaluate neighborhood demographics as a factor far exceeding the condition of the appraised property itself. With the inclusion of these “scientific appraisal standards” into their uniform lending policies, FHLBB officials rated entire residential communities as hazardous bank investments whenever they were inhabited by undesirable occupants. Ultimately, the standardized lending policies of the FHLBB systematically disadvantaged low-income and minority city-dwelling residents from obtaining mortgage financing, and by midcentury they exacerbated the disproportionately substandard urban housing conditions endured by nonwhites in the United States.

  abstract = {Inclusionary zoning (IZ) has become an increasingly popular tool for providing affordable housing in an economically integrative manner. IZ policies typically require developers to set aside a proportion of units in market-rate residential developments to be made affordable for lower-income households in exchange for development rights or zoning variances. These policies are considered "inclusionary" because they are intended to allow lower- and moderate-income households to buy or rent property in middle- and upper-income communities. This report examines 11 IZ programs across the United States to determine the extent to which the policies serve lower-income families and provide IZ recipients with access to low-poverty neighborhoods and residentially assign them to high-performing schools, thereby promoting the academic achievement and educational attainment of their children. It also considers ways in which IZ policies vary and how different design features might affect the success of the programs in promoting affordable housing and social inclusion for IZ recipients. Finally, it identifies key program-design aspects that shape the potential to meet the goals of providing affordable housing to low-income households and promoting social inclusion for IZ recipients.},

  abstract = {Over the last three decades, Connecticut has shifted from being one of the most egalitarian states to having one of the biggest income gaps between rich and poor households, as indicated in this report by the Connecticut Association for Human Services and Connecticut Voices for Children.

Over this period, Connecticut experienced the greatest increase in income inequality among all states between its high and low-income households.  In 1977-79, the gap between the richest fifth and the middle fifth of families in Connecticut was relatively low, ranking 42nd among all states, but the state ranked 7th highest in inequality by 2005-07.  Similarly, the gap between the richest and poorest fifth of households is now the 3rd worst in the country, up from 46th.
The greatest share of income gains have gone to the wealthiest 1 percent, who have vastly outpaced even the very well-off. The share of total state Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) going to the top 1 percent has soared over the last two decades, increasing from 17\% to 28\%.
The 99th percentile of taxpayers in Connecticut earn about \$766,000 in state AGI, over \$500,000 more than the \$225,000 earned by well-off households at the 95th percentile. The income of the near-rich is actually closer to that of the poorest fifth of households, who earn \$17,000, than it is to the \$766,000 earned by the wealthiest Connecticut residents.
Connecticut’s inequality ranks second only to New York’s among U.S. states on the Gini coefficient, one of the most widely used measures of inequality.},

Falling house prices and crazy-low interest rates have put home-buying in reach of more people, but renters continue to suffer as the supply of apartments shrinks and median wages fall, a report Tuesday shows.

The so-called housing wage, the hourly pay a household would have to make in order to afford a typical 2-bedroom apartment, rose to \$23.58 in 2011, from \$23.37 a year earlier, the Hartford-based Partnership for Strong Communities said.

That’s about \$49,000 a year in income, and it assumes the apartment is \$1,225 a month, since housing is considered affordable if it costs less than 30 percent of a household’s income.

That increase in the housing wage is 
less than in several recent years; the figure was \$13.94, or \$29,000, in 2004.

And the state –last in the nation in housing construction in 2011 and over the last decade — is short of the number of low-cost or subsidized apartments that are available, by 82,000, the report said.},

The sum will not be evenly distributed to all of the schools in the district, as it may seem when described by some sources as being given to the Hartford Public Schools. Rather, it is primarily earmarked for Achievement First and Jumoke Academy. David Medina, the Hartford Public Schools’ Director of External Communications, says this money is intended to “deepen collaboration” between the district-charter school partnerships.

Of the \$5 million, three percent (\$150,000) will go to the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving for its role as a fiscal agent.

Reasonable assumptions about the distribution of preferences over race, class, and school characteristics suggest that the segregating choices of students from advantaged backgrounds are likely to outweigh any integrating choices by disadvantaged students. The results of our empirical analysis are consistent with these theoretical considerations. Using information on the actual schools students attend and on the schools in their assigned attendance zones, we find that schools in Durham are more segregated by race and class as a result of school choice programs than they would be if all students attended their geographically assigned schools. In addition, we find that the effects of choice on segregation by class are larger than the effects on segregation by race.},

After controlling for background characteristics, we find that parent satisfaction with their child’s previous school was not a predictor of considering a private school. Rather, parent involvement seems to be a more important indicator of whether or not a parent would consider sending their child to a private school. In this case, parents are not ‘pushed’ away from public schools, contrary to much public rhetoric that suggests private schools are somehow inherently ‘better’ than public schools and parents who are dissatisfied with their public schools will opt for private schools. Instead, these findings suggest a ‘pull’ towards private schools. Parents may perceive that parent involvement and parent communication are more easily facilitated and valued in private schools.},

Since white, advantaged parents are more likely to get their children into the highest-status schools regardless of the school choice policy in place, we believed that more research was needed on how those parents interact with school choice policies and whether they would support changes to those policies that would lead to less segregation across schools. Our interviews with advantaged New York City parents suggest that many are bothered by the segregation but that they are concerned that their children gain access to the “best” (mostly white) schools. The contradictions inherent in their choices are reconcilable, we argue, by offering more diverse and undivided school options.},

No longer can public education be characterized as a monopoly. Sponsored by the National Center on School Choice (NCSC), this handbook makes readily available the most rigorous and policy-relevant research on K-12 school choice. Coverage includes charters, vouchers, home schooling, magnet schools, cyber schools, and other forms of choice, with the ultimate goal of defining the current state of this evolving field of research, policy, and practice. Key Features include:Comprehensive – this is the first book to provide a comprehensive review of what is known about the major forms of school choice from multiple perspectives: historical, political, economic, legal, methodological, and international. It also includes work on the governance, structure, process, effectiveness, and costs of school choice.Readable – the editors and authors have taken care to translate rigorous research findings into comprehensible prose accessible to a broad range of readers.International – in addition to thorough coverage of domestic research, the volume also draws on international and comparative studies of choice in foreign countries. Expertise – the National Center on School Choice (NCSC) is a consortium that is headquartered at Vanderbilt University and includes the following partners: Brookings Institution, Brown University, Harvard University, National Bureau of Economic Research, Northwest Evaluation Association, and Stanford University. This book is suitable for researchers, faculty and graduate students in education policy studies, politics of education, and social foundations of education. It should also be of interest to inservice administrators and policy makers.},

However, for both of these arguments to be true, charter schools would have to replace low-performing public schools in currently disadvantaged, but revitalizing, neighborhoods. Using data from the Chicago Public Schools, the Common Core, and the Census, we examine the neighborhood and school-level factors that account for where elementary schools closed and opened in Chicago during the late 1990s and 2000s. We find that schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods were more likely to close, but only because these were also underperforming and under-enrolled schools. After controlling for educational demand, new schools were more likely to open in neighborhoods that showed signs of socioeconomic revitalization and declining proportions of white residents.},

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Efforts to account for the history of public housing in America are fraught with competing narratives. Many scholars, policy analysts, architects, and planners seek explanations for the successes and failures of housing projects from within the program itself. Some argue that projects rise and fall based on the management performance of housing authorities, while others look to racism, concentrated poverty, crime, and other social conditions. For many, the challenges faced by public housing result from the alienating and dehumanizing qualities of modernist architecture. Still, others argue that the Housing Act of 1937 was compromised from the beginning and, thus, produced compromised results. This article acknowledges all of these factors as important yet insufficient to account for overall public housing performance; it reframes the narrative of public housing within broader urban conditions, suggesting that the fate of public housing is intimately tied to the fate of the cities that surround them. Takeaway for practice: Current accounts of the fate of public housing tend to reflect narrow managerial, planning, and architectural concerns. As a result, the literature on public housing insufficiently informs long-term policy decisions and planning practices. Solutions will only emerge when policymakers and planners take into account the impact of capital flight, social disinvestment, and the weak powers of cities to overcome such obstacles. After all, these urban conditions apply as much to recently created HOPE VI neighborhoods as to the high-rise public housing neighborhoods they replaced. Research support: None.},

  abstract = {The first major battle over school choice came out of struggles over equalizing and integrating schools in the civil rights era, when it became apparent that choice could be either a serious barrier or a significant tool for reaching these goals. The second large and continuing movement for choice was part of the very different anti-government, individualistic, market-based movement of a more conservative period in which many of the lessons of that earlier period were forgotten, though choice was once again presented as the answer to racial inequality. This book brings civil rights back into the center of the debate and tries to move from doctrine to empirical research in exploring the many forms of choice and their very different consequences for equity in U.S. schools. Leading researchers conclude that although helping minority children remains a central justification for choice proponents, ignoring the essential civil rights dimensions of choice plans risks compounding rather than remedying racial inequality.

In this paper, we examine the extent to which people value teacher value-added information
by examining how the release of such information is capitalized into home prices. With the
exception of Gibbons et. al., to our knowledge this is the first analysis that examines whether
housing markets are responsive to school value-added, which is important to understand given
the increasing prevalence of value-added models in K-12 education and the increasing availability of these data for parents. Further, our identification strategy avoids known problems with
boundary discontinuity papers such as sorting around the boundary that can lead to difficult to
interpret local average treatment effects and difficulties with attributing differences in housing
prices across boundaries to school quality or other correlates of school quality measures such
as demographics.
To estimate the impact of school value-added on housing prices, we use a unique and unanticipated release of value-added information for schools and teachers in the Los Angeles Unified
School District (LAUSD). In August, 2010 the Los Angeles Times (LA Times) released valueadded estimates for 6,000 teachers in over 470 elementary schools in LAUSD on their website,
which was easily accessed to the public and searchable by school and teacher.},

  title = {Building {{Knowledge}} \& {{Confidence}}: {{How Achieve Hartford}}'s {{Choice Education Program Assists Capital City Parents}}},
  abstract = {recently completed the baseline year of operation of its Choice 
Education Program.  Evolving from the initial goal two years ago of providing 
Hartford families with up-to-date information on schools through the SmartChoices
website, Achieve Hartford!’s Choice Education Program was created to address the reality 
that many families cannot access and fully utilize information online without assistance.  
Information and training related to school choice needed to be brought out to parents in 
their communities, and – using mobile technology and the SmartChoices website as tools – the 
Achieve Hartford!’s Choice Education Program has delivered just that, and more. 
The purpose of Achieve Hartford!’s Choice Education Program is to help families gain the 
knowledge and confidence they need to effectively navigate school choice in Hartford on 
behalf of their children.  The intended outcome is not only to help more families make more
informed choices, but also to help families in Hartford become familiar with the school 
district processes they need to understand in order to have a sustained, positive relationship 
with the education system in the long term.  
All indicators point to a very successful first year of operation, with outcomes that include:
More than 80 visits to community-based pre-school providers and Hartford schools,
More than 50 pre-school staff trained, and
More than 900 families empowered to make informed decisions on behalf of their 
children.
This report presents both a detailed explanation – and evaluation – of the 2011 Choice 
Education Program administered by Achieve Hartford! on behalf of Hartford parents and 
school children.  The report also documents best practices and key factors necessary to 
running a successful outreach program of this kind, as well as some systemic challenges
present in carrying out this work.},

This former farming community quickly became the poster child for the racially and culturally shifting suburban landscape and a harbinger of storms to come. What differentiates Eden Prairie from the dozens, if not hundreds, of places similarly situated, is that educators here refused to cave under pressure from an organized, privileged class who saw no reason to mess with a “neighborhood school” organization that incorporated economic and racial segregation into its design. In this Story from the Field, we learn that courage and flexibility may be the qualities educators in the changing American suburb need most of all. But in the long term, unless state and national government leaders affirm a vision of integration and develop clear plans for achieving it, forward thinking suburban educators like Eden Prairie’s will be left on their own and unjustly vulnerable as they face some of the most vexing challenges of our time.},

(2) Clustering: Are high-achieving students widely distributed across the district, or are they more likely to be clustered with peers who have similar characteristics, or attend similar schools, or reside in similar neighborhoods? By analyzing statistically significant patterns among over 33,000 Hartford-resident HPS students in grades 3 to 8 from 2008-09 to 2011-12, we found that the proportion of high-achieving students who left the HPS dataset is not significantly different from the proportion who stayed (around 15 to 18 percent) over time, but there are significant differences in school zone, magnet school status, and other variables.},

The system of mortgage insurance established in this period sowed the seeds of center city economic deterioration.

  abstract = {"When Pennington finally made the move to Hartford, he became part of a highly organized and engaged African American community. African Americans, after segregated treatment, formally organized a church in 1826, which eventually became the Talcott Street Congregational Church and later Faith Congregational Church. The church’s quest for Pennington’s services as pastor began in 1838, but he declined the offer. In 1840, though, the determined Hartford congregation managed to persuade the talented minister to relocate. Once installed in the pulpit in Hartford, he pastored the church and taught in a local school for African American children. Although Hartford’s regular school system technically accepted all children, in 1830 African American parents, who disliked the treatment of their children in the regular system, requested a separate school. Parents established the North African and South African schools. They housed the first school at Talcott Street, while African American Methodists provided space for the other school. Amos Beman served as the best known of the early teachers; however, he moved on to pastor the Temple Street Church in New Haven. Politically and socially, James Mars, Henry Foster, and Ann Plato, faithful members of the church, were already formidable leaders in the community. Deacon Mars was a member of the executive committee of the Connecticut Anti-Slavery Society, while Foster led the efforts to develop a state temperance society for African Americans. Mars joined a coalition that fought to free Nancy, an enslaved woman brought from Georgia by her owner. In 1843 Reverend Pennington served as one of the Connecticut Anti-Slavery Society’s delegates to the world anti-slavery convention. At the September 2, 1840 meeting of that organization, he accepted the group’s presidency. In 1844 the talented Plato taught students in the Elm Street School.

Although his eight years as pastor included a trip to England and two years on leave, Pennington plunged headlong into building up the educational and cultural life of African Americans. He knew that he was part of burgeoning leadership class. His writings for the well-respected Colored American, a leading African American newspaper published in New York, revealed his concern and passion for improving the quality of the education and facilities. Members of the state temperance society considered the newspaper “vital” to the empowerment of African Americans. In its pages, Pennington chastised parents and school committees for their failures. He urged parents to be not satisfied with the mere rudiments of education, while he suggested that school committees needed to upgrade buildings, equipment, furniture, and instructional materials.

When Augustus Washington, a Dartmouth College-trained student and future daguerreotypist, came to Hartford, Pennington and his wife taught and served as administrators at a school in two rooms in his church’s lower level. Washington also became a teacher of African American children in Hartford. Although he only taught two years, he impressed Thomas Robbins, a visiting clergyman, with his skills as an educator. When Ann Plato published a collection of her writings, Pennington proudly wrote the foreword. He used her writings as proof that African Americans were capable of intellectual pursuits, not simply the drudgery of slave labor. The minister suggested that African Americans should purchase the book."},

  abstract = {Before I founded 50CAN, I served as the chief operating officer of ConnCAN, the pioneering Connecticut education policy and advocacy organization started in 2005. One of our first projects was a labor of love that involved poring over thousands of spreadsheets of student achievement data--information the state had collected but which nobody had done very much with--and visiting dozens of schools to learn more about who was beating the odds for their kids. We called these "success story schools."

Nearly a year into the project, two schools emerged as clear models of success. They were places where kids were succeeding beyond what demographics or zip code would predict, and they were institutions that seemed to offer lessons about leadership and learning that could inform statewide policymaking. One was Dwight Elementary, a traditional district school in Hartford that had undergone a dramatic turnaround under the leadership of principal Kathy Greider. The other was Amistad Academy, a public charter school in New Haven founded by Dacia Toll, whose students consistently outperformed their peers from other schools.

Although the most blatant forms of housing discrimination have declined since the first national paired-testing study in 1977, the forms that persist raise the costs of housing search for minorities and restrict their housing options. Looking forward, national fair housing policies must continue to adapt to address the patterns of discrimination and disparity that persist today.},

The Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT) previously evaluated the I-84 viaduct structure in Hartford.  That analysis concluded that the
¾-mile long structure through the central area of Hartford while in need of immediate repairs, will also need to be fully reconstructed or replaced within 10-15 years.  A short-term repair project was recently completed and ConnDOT continues to monitor the structure, but these repairs are not considered a permanent fix.  ConnDOT recognizes there is a need to continue the planning and community involvement process for the longer-term reconstruction or replacement of the Viaduct.

CRCOG managed the initial phase of the Viaduct planning process on behalf of the City, working through a committee of stakeholders entitled the HUB of Hartford.  The goal of the study was to identify several preliminary, technically sound alternatives to reconstruct, replace or remove this structure and evaluate their ability to improve the quality of life in surrounding neighborhoods, support existing businesses and promote economic development.  The final report is available in the Study Documents section below.

Since the completion of the initial planning study, ConnDOT has taken the lead on the planning process.},

The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has been a significant instrument for this policy. It has biased zoning toward the production of suburban development, an urban form marked by sprawling forms and the strict segregation of uses. While the FHA’s impact on racial segregation and the marketplace have been well researched, the FHA’s impact on zoning, and therefore on the vital components of urban form including the arrangement of uses and densities, has not been. Using a case study of the Los Angeles experience, this paper argues that the FHA, by offering a financing option for products much in demand, persuaded cities to adjust their zoning according to federal standards. The FHA provided a convincing case that zoning for lower-density residential uses and preserving them was the best way to accommodate the huge market of hopeful homeowners eager to acquire FHA-backed mortgages.},

political will to make the necessary changes has never materialized. A review of the research and 
progress since the decision was first announced suggests that this failure stems from a lack of 
incentivization for all of the major parties whose support would be necessary to turn the Sheff 
decision into a reality. Neither the state, the city, nor the suburbs see integration as a particularly 
appealing objective, and due to the nature of the Court’s decision, few measures are in place to 
incentivize their cooperation or punish their inaction. Students and parents undoubtedly have the

  abstract = {"This thesis is an analysis of Career and Technical Education as a response to the low quality of public education in Hartford, Connecticut. Hartford Public Schools recently adopted the Career Academy model of CTE to restructure its failing high schools. This model is an improvement upon traditional forms of CTE, and graduation rates and test scores have increased since Hartford’s Academies opened in 2008. Still, whether Career Academies are an appropriate solution to the chronic underperformance of the city’s schools will depend upon their compatibility with the broader educational policies being implemented by the district and the State. The two primary policies to consider are school choice at the district level and desegregation at the state level. Career Academies are not perfectly compatible with either of these broader agendas. However, school choice and desegregation measures have their own limitations that will prevent them from generating lasting improvements. For either policy to work, Hartford will need high-performing local schools, yet neither school choice nor desegregation can create these schools on its own. Policy recommendations are offered for making Career Academies more compatible with the district’s and the State’s agendas in order for all systems to operate more effectively. Ultimately, Hartford’s history of racial and economic concentration needs to be reversed in order to achieve long-term success. Doing so can only be accomplished if the city has high-quality local schools with which to attract a diverse population, and Career Academies offer significant promise to fill this role at the high school level."

  abstract = {They were once powerhouses, these old industrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest, centers of employment, finance and culture. But since the mid-20th century, these cities have lost jobs and population and now face daunting social, economic and operational challenges.
But a regional economy doesn't stop at the city line, especially with a small city such as Hartford, so legacy cities have to be better connected to their regions, the authors say. Each needs the others' assets; they rise and fall together. The Brookings Institution has persuasively argued that it is the metropolitan regions, not cities or states, that are the country's economic engines.

Hartford's connections with its suburbs is not strong. There's a regional water and sewer authority and an active council of governments, but this remains the land of localism. Could there ever be more formal regional governance here?

It would be a hard sell, to be sure, particularly with schools. But perhaps — someday — something like the two-tier Miami-Dade structure might appeal, in which each municipality has an elected government and provides some services such as police, while a county or regional government oversees two dozen other departments including parks, public works, economic development and transit.

The authors acknowledge the political obstacles to creating such an entity, but say the potential benefits — cost savings and efficiencies in government and a more productive planning and economic development system — are worth the effort.

  abstract = {Purpose: Suburban school districts have undergone significant demographic shifts over the past several decades. The research literature to date, however, has yet to explore how suburban district leaders are responding to such changes, or examine the factors that shape response. In this article, we apply a “zone of mediation” framework to examine how the leaders of one large and rapidly changing suburban school district in Texas responded to its changing student population. In our analysis, we consider the technical, normative, and political dimensions of this district’s response to demographic shifts. Research Methods/Approach: We conducted an in-depth qualitative case study of a large and rapidly changing district in the San Antonio Metropolitan area, which we named “Southern Independent School District.” Our data included interviews with 28 district-level and community actors and interviews with 26 educators across three “focus” schools that were undergoing particularly rapid demographic shifts. Findings and Implications: We found that Southern Independent School District’s response to demographic change focused intensely on technical changes in curriculum and instruction. Such technical changes we found were explicitly adopted to address the needs of the increasing proportion of low-income students and students of color within the district. At the same time, we illustrate how the district failed to address the more challenging normative and political dynamics within the district. This failure, we show, placed significant limits upon the technical reforms that were adopted.},

Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This study reviews political science theories and findings to inform our understanding of how politics affects efforts in order to increase data usage in education policy and school reform and to lay a foundation for future research on the issue.

Research Design: This is a review and analytical synthesis of literature that for the most part has not looked at the education policy arena in order to derive insights relevant to contemporary efforts to infuse education policy with greater attention to data.

Conclusions/Recommendations: Rather than block the door to politics, those who hope to promote informed policy making might consider ways to use politics to protect and defend high-quality data and their informed application.},

  abstract = {Over the last two decades, state and federal laws and grant programs, such as state accountability polices, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), Race to the Top, Title I School Improvement Grants, and State Longitudinal Data System Grants, have given state education agencies (SEAs) considerably more responsibilities for directing and guiding the improvement of low-performing schools. At the same time, they have pressed SEAs and school districts to incorporate research-based school improvement policies and practices in their statewide systems of support for low-performing schools, technical assistance for districts, professional development for teachers, and school improvement programs. Policymakers have urged SEAs to engage with organizations external to their own agencies to extend their strained capacity, and to help them collect and use research or other evidence. A variety of organizations involved in this enterprise have emerged over the last two decades. For example, the 2002 authorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act’s (ESEA) comprehensive assistance centers was specifically designed to provide and encourage SEA’s use of research.

Although studies of districts’ and schools’ use of research exist, we know little about how SEAs search for, select, and use research and other kinds of evidence in their school improvement strategies. While one might assume similarities in research use behaviors, both the organizational structures of SEAs and the population of external organizations with which they interact are quite different than schools and districts, and the most recent in-depth study of SEAs was conducted nearly 20 years ago. The exploratory study on which this brief is based was designed to fill that gap by examining: 1) where SEA staff search for research, evidence-based, and practitioner knowledge related to school improvement; 2) whether and how SEA staff use research and these other types of knowledge to design, implement, and refine state school improvement policies, programs and practices; and, 3) how SEAs are organized to manage and use such knowledge.},

  volume = {115},
  url = {http://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?contentid=16988},
  abstract = {Background/Context: At the close of the first decade of the 21st century, the intersection of race, geography and opportunity is increasingly referred to as spatial racism. School quality and resources, municipal services, employment opportunities, accessibility of transportation, exposure to pollution, and tax rates all vary dramatically across a network of invisible boundary lines that carve up U.S. metro areas into racially and socioeconomically distinctive spaces.
Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study:This analysis explores how district boundary lines and school desegregation policy have impacted metropolitan school and housing integration levels over the past two decades.

Setting: The study focuses specifically on the South, where the most comprehensive desegregation strategies were pursued. Based on varying experiences with city-suburban school district mergers, four metros—Richmond, Virginia; Charlotte-Mecklenburg County, North Carolina; Louisville-Jefferson County, Kentucky; and Chattanooga-Hamilton County, Tennessee—were identified for study between the years 1990 and 2010. This time period encompassed a rising trend of unitary status for school districts, the serious resegregation of students, and growing demographic complexity across the country.

Research Design: This is a quantitative analysis of school and housing segregation trends that relies upon Geographic Information Systems (GIS) maps to depict spatial patterns of isolation. School enrollment and segregation trends are derived from the National Center for Educational Statistics’ Common Core of Data. Housing patterns describing the distribution and segregation of persons by race and poverty status are explored using block group-level information from the U.S. Census Bureau’s decennial census. Segregation is measured using the Index of Dissimilarity (D).

Findings/Results: Efforts to overcome the divisive nature of district boundary lines, in conjunction with comprehensive school desegregation policy, were related to unambiguous progress in combating both school and housing segregation. This central finding suggests that, in some ways, school policy can become housing policy.

Conclusions/Recommendations: How we provide equal educational opportunity to an increasingly diverse population of students is one of the principal concerns facing the country today. As a nation, however, we are currently allowing a labyrinthine system of school-district boundary lines to dictate the geographic distribution of learning opportunities. This study provides concrete examples of metros implementing a more regional approach to educational equity. It recommends that other metro area consider taking similar steps to subvert the segregating power of school-district boundaries.

The district also is holding its first citywide Kindergarten Fair to help parents navigate the enrollment process. In addition to distributing a magnet school guide, the district will provide a complete guide of all New Haven schools this year.

“Parents have long been asking for a simplified process that clearly lays out kindergarten choices and offers a fair path to school enrollment. These changes will help strengthen the overall experience for families as they begin their journey with New Haven Public Schools.

  url = {http://www.ctvoices.org/publications/making-sense-vertical-scales-alternative-view-connecticut-mastery-test-results},
  abstract = {Using an alternate measure of educational progress – vertical scale scores – can present a different picture of change over time in the performance of Connecticut students. Each summer, the state reports the results of the Connecticut Mastery Test (CMT), by showing what percent of students scored at five different levels: below basic, basic, proficient, goal, and advanced.  These types of “standards-based” levels are the most widely cited measures of educational progress in Connecticut and will take on increasing importance in the Governor and General Assembly’s recent education law.

However, standards-based reporting may miss improvement that occurs within levels and does not explain improvement over time on different grade-level tests within a subject area.  Therefore, the State Department of Education developed an additional improvement indicator in 2007 -- vertical scale scores.

Vertical scales allow us to understand how students perform on the state tests of math or reading in one grade compared to the next grade, despite more difficult and different math content.  Vertical scale scores are a rough indicator of improvement on the standard CMT from one year to the next, following the same group, or matched cohort, of children.

This report, which looks at the value and limitations of standards-based and vertical scale CMT measures, finds that

On average, students are making progress on the vertical scales on the standard CMT in math and reading, even though this growth may not be reflected on the standards-based level reports.
Racial and ethnic minority and low-income students had lower vertical scale scores, on average, than white and more affluent students in 3rd grade math and reading, the first year that the standard Connecticut Mastery Test is administered to students.  Within racial and ethnic groups, children from lower-income families (eligible for free and reduced price meals) tend to score lower on the vertical scale scores in third grade.
Despite different starting points, black, Latino, English Language Learning students, and students with disabilities on average experienced a comparable amount of growth or improvement on the standard CMT in math and reading from one year-grade 3 in 2009 -- to the next-grade 4 in 2010 -- compared to the statewide average.},

A quality public education system should provide a well-rounded, balanced curriculum and help prepare children for their adult lives. While Connecticut has a strong public education system, we need better ways to assess our children’s learning and the work that schools perform. 

This brief for electoral candidates makes several recommendations to improve and broaden educational opportunities:

Public education should support a broad set of goals for children’s development and well-being. The state’s educational system should continue to provide a broad educational program that serves all children’s learning and developmental needs including academic skills, critical thinking, the arts and literature, preparation for skilled work, social skills, citizenship, and emotional health.
Use a variety of methods and indicators, in addition to standardized tests, to assess whether children receive a quality education.
Require schools to adopt initiatives that promote a positive school climate and to regularly report on their suspension, truancy and attrition rates.
The ECS funding must keep pace with students’ need in the coming years.},

  abstract = {The practice of using free and reduced price meal (FRPM) eligibility as a proxy for poverty is pervasive in educational research and policymaking. More thorough consideration of the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) makes at least one thing clear: the statistics help us understand how many students are eligible for the program, but they have considerable limitations when used as an indicator of student need or socioeconomic status:

Eligibility for free or reduced price meals does not entirely capture a student’s access (or lack of access) to economic resources such as parental income, education level, and family wealth.
The combined percentage of students eligible for free and reduced meals does not show income differences between the two income categories.
Districts and schools that have the same combined percentage of students eligible for FRPM may have substantial differences in the percentage of their students that are eligible for free meals.
Participation rates in the NSLP may vary based on different certification procedures at the district level.
The Connecticut Education Data and Research website collects and reports FRPM data differently from the State Department of Education Bureau of Health, Nutrition, Family Services, and Adult Education. Thus, there are at least two sources of FRPM data with different numbers of eligible students reported for the same schools and districts.
We recommend caution in using FRPM statistics and consideration of alternative measures to indicate student need and/or socioeconomic status.},

  abstract = {This report finds that the exclusion of thousands of students with disabilities from reported Connecticut Mastery Test results has distorted reported trends in test scores. Following test scores from year to year in the same grade, the study finds that statewide improvements in standard Connecticut Mastery Test (CMT) scores reported by the Connecticut State Department of Education (SDE) between 2008 and 2009 -- the period of the largest reported gains -- were largely the result of the exclusion of students with disabilities from these standard test results, rather than overall improvements in performance. For example, 84\% of the reported improvement in 4th grade math proficiency between 2008 and 2009 and 69\% of the improvement in 8th grade reading proficiency could be attributed to the exclusion of these students. Much of the reported improvements in later years could also be attributed to this exclusion, though there were some modest overall gains as well.

In 2009, state and federal policy changes enabled school districts to offer a modified assessment (MAS) to students with disabilities that the districts determined would not have passed the CMT in math and/or reading. As a result of these policy changes, the share of students taking the regular CMT declined substantially. Prior to 2009, students who did not reach the proficient level on the CMT because of their disabilities were included in statewide CMT results. In 2009, thousands of low-scoring students were assigned to take the MAS test instead of the standard CMT, and these students were not included in the CMT results. Thus, CMT scores reported by the State Department of Education appeared to improve in large part because these low-scoring students were no longer included in the calculations.},

These standardized tests are administered on an annual basis to students in grades 3 through 8 (CMT) and in grade 10 (CAPT) to assess how well students, schools, and districts in Connecticut are meeting the standards of achievement set by the State Department of Education.In August, Achieve Hartford! released an analysis of the district’s performance on these tests, specifically examining the impact the district’s different models of schools havehad on student achievement.This new report looks at the student results from a different angle: the student cohort. Whereas the current method of reporting CMT and CAPT results provides a “snapshot” of student achievement in a given year, the cohort approach allows us to track the performance of a group of students as they progress from late elementary school into high school. With this analysis, we can address the important question of whetherstudents are building on gains in learning from prior years.The purpose of this report, however, is not to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the district or particular schools; instead, this report seeks to provide (1) a detailed explanation of a relatively new method of measuring student and school performance, (2) demonstrate the utility of this new method, and (3) highlight just a couple areas of success and concern for the benefit of not only the school district, but for the greater community as well},

“This concept of a lottery for an education has to end. We have to strive for all children to have a quality education,” Hartford parent Millie Archinegas told the state board

Also claims that:
"However, data provided by the State Department of Education show no major difference in demographics between the magnet and Hartford schools.

The Hartford Studies Project gathered images of the Black experience in Hartford from photographs in collections at the Connecticut State Library (CSL), Connecticut Historical Society (CHS), the Hartford Collection at Hartford Public Library (HPL), and private collections.

The Hartford Black History Project digitalized this collection of images and placed them on line so that it might become more readily accessible to Hartford public school students.

Choice advocates charge that choice will improve access to quality schools for disadvantaged minority students (Chubb \& Moe 1990; Coons \& Sugarman, 1978; Godwin \& Kemerer, 2002; Viteritti, 1999). Critics argue that choice is unlikely to benefit minority students, but they are divided as to why this may be the case. Some maintain that unfettered choice leads to racial segregation (Henig, 1996; Mickelson, 2005; Saporito, 2003); others maintain that while choice may be successful in reducing segregation at the building level, choice programs may be problematic to the extent that they segregate schools at the classroom level (Wells \& Crain, 1997; Wells, Holme, \& Vasudeva, 2000; Wells \& Roda, 2009; West, 1994). I use data from the eighth-grade wave of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study to examine these questions. Results indicate that the racial composition of magnet schools is not statistically different from regular public schools; however, magnet schools are more heterogeneous at the classroom level, but only with respect to White/Hispanic racial composition. In particular, honors classes in magnet schools are significantly more diverse than honors classes in regular public schools, but only with regard to White/Hispanic diversity.},

During this period, public housing tracts were created to shelter the many war workers and their families drawn to the Hartford area by the availability of defense-related jobs. The United States government funded these developments; therefore, local housing officials needed to abide by federal laws regarding occupancy. Federal Housing authorities eventually did require West Hartford to admit African Americans; however, town residents and leaders prevailed by specifying residency criteria in such a way as to maintain the demographic makeup of their virtually all-white community. Racist actions such as these, even when they occurred decades ago, have been factors in shaping the present-day demographics of West Hartford and other towns in the state."},

As a member of the Bloomfield Board of Education, Bernstein recognized that Connecticut was the only state that did not guarantee its citizens a constitutional right to an education. Bernstein thus decided to draft a new amendment to address this problem. After days of being ignored by his Democratic Party superiors and, finally, threatening to confront the media about his concerns, Bernstein’s request was met. Delegates at the 1965 Connecticut Constitutional Convention passed Bernstein’s amendment which guarantees free public education to every child. This set the stage for a series of prominent educational lawsuits, including Horton v. Meskill (1970), Sheff v. O’Neill (1989), and Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding (CCJEF) v.

Although these explicitly racist policies are no longer legal, research shows that their legacy often persists well beyond their termination. For example, historical data reveals long-term patterns of inequality that can be traced back to racist zoning codes of the past. Of the housing barriers that ethnic minorities within the US have faced in the 20th century, “redlining” is perhaps the most talked about—and for good reason. Redlining is the nickname given to the practice of rating certain neighborhoods as undesirable investment choices due to their racial and socioeconomic demographics. Banks then used these ratings when determining whether or not to authorize loan transactions for home purchases and improvements in those communities. By effectively directing capital investment away from “redlined” neighborhoods, this practice shaped the demographic patterns as well as the built environments of cities and suburbs across the US.

  url = {https://www.russellsage.org/publications/choosing-homes-choosing-schools},
  abstract = {A series of policy shifts over the past decade promises to change how Americans decide where to send their children to school. In theory, the expanded use of standardized test scores and the boom in charter schools will allow parents to evaluate their assigned neighborhood school, or move in search of a better option. But what kind of data do parents actually use while choosing schools? Are there differences among suburban and urban families? How do parents choices influence school and residential segregation? Choosing Homes, Choosing Schools presents a breakthrough analysis of the new era of school choice, and what it portends for American neighborhoods.

The distinguished contributors to Choosing Homes, Choosing Schools investigate the complex relationships among education, neighborhood social networks, and larger patterns of inequality. Paul Jargowsky reviews recent trends in segregation by race and class, and shows that while segregation between blacks and whites has declined overall since 1970, white parents are still more likely to choose to live in predominantly white neighborhoods. This skewed residential selection in turn drives racial inequality in public schools. Annette Lareau draws on interviews with parents in three suburban neighborhoods to analyze school-choice decisions. Surprisingly, she finds that middle- and upper-class parents do not rely on active research, such as school tours or test scores. Instead, their decision-making was largely informal and passive, with most simply trusting advice from friends and others in their network. Elliot Weinginer looks at how class differences among urban parents affect their approaches to choosing schools. He finds that while parents of all backgrounds actively consider their children s education choices, middle- and upper-class parents relied more on federally mandated school report cards, district websites, and online forums, while working-class parents used network contacts to gain information on school quality. Amy Schwartz and Leanna Stiefel explore the connections between housing policy and education reform. They demonstrate the shortcomings of policies focused exclusively on school choice or the practice of allowing students to cross district boundaries to better schools and instead advocate for reducing educational inequality by expanding residential choice through measures such as housing subsidies and the redevelopment of public housing to include schools and community centers.

Little previous research has explored what role school concerns play in the preferences of white and minority parents for particular neighborhoods, and how the racial and economic makeup of both neighborhoods and schools mutually reinforce each other. Choosing Homes, Choosing Schools adroitly addresses this gap and provides a firmer understanding of how Americans choose where to live and send their children to school.},

  url = {http://www.ctvoices.org/publications/choice-watch-diversity-and-access-connecticuts-school-choice-programs},
  abstract = {This analysis of enrollment in Connecticut’s school choice programs raises concerns about their relative compliance with established goals of racial and ethnic integration and equal access for all students.  Many of Connecticut’s school choice programs fall short in advancing the goal of racial and ethnic integration.  In spite of state laws requiring charter and magnet schools to reduce racial and ethnic isolation of students, only interdistrict magnet schools are typically integrated, and a majority of the state’s charter schools are highly segregated.  The report also raises concerns about the underrepresentation in school choice programs of students who do not speak English as a first language and students with special education needs.

The analysis examines the demographics of students in Connecticut’s interdistrict school choice programs – programs that permit parents to enroll their children in schools outside their local school districts.  It focuses on magnet, charter, and technical schools.  Among the key findings:

While both charter and interdistrict magnet schools are required by state law to reduce racial and ethnic segregation of students, only magnet schools are held to a measurable standard – a student body between 25\% and 75\% students of color. A majority of interdistrict magnet schools (62\%) meet this standard. By contrast, a majority of charter schools (65\%) are highly segregated, enrolling over 90\% students of color.  While technical schools have no measurable integration standard, a majority (56\%) would meet the requirement for magnet schools.
Students who do not speak English as a first language are under-represented in Connecticut’s school choice programs, compared to the school districts of the towns in which the programs are located.  A majority of all interdistrict magnet, charter, and technical schools enroll students identified as being English Language Learners (ELL) at a substantially lower rate (five percentage points lower) than the local school districts of the towns in which they are located. 
Over one-third of magnet and charter schools and a majority of technical schools enroll students identified as requiring special education at a substantially lower rate (five percentage points lower) than the local school districts of the towns in which they are located.},

  abstract = {Research on the housing choice voucher program and housing mobility interventions
shows that even with assistance, it is difficult for poor minority families to relocate to,
and remain in, low-poverty neighborhoods. Scholars suggest that both structural forces
and individual preferences help explain these residential patterns. However, less attention
is paid towhere preferences come from, and how they respond to policies and social
structure to shape residential decisionmaking. In this paper, we use data from fieldwork
with 110 participants in the Baltimore Mobility Program (BMP), an assisted mobility
voucher program, to demonstrate how residential preferences can shift over time as a
function of living in higher opportunity neighborhoods. Since 2003, BMP has helped
over 2,000 low-income African American families move from high-poverty, highly segregated
neighborhoods in Baltimore City to low-poverty, racially mixed neighborhoods
throughout the Baltimore region. Along with intensive counseling and unique program
administration, these new neighborhood contexts helped many women to shift what
we term residential choice frameworks: the criteria that families use to assess housing
and neighborhoods. Parents who participated in the mobility program raised their expectations
for what neighborhoods, homes, and schools can provide for their children
and themselves. Parents report new preferences for the “quiet” of suburban locations,
and strong consideration of school quality and neighborhood diversity when thinking
about where to live. Our findings suggest that housing policies should employ counseling
to ensure relocation to and sustained residence in low-poverty communities.
Our work also underscores how social structure, experience, and policy opportunities
influence preferences, and how these preferences, in turn, affect policy outcomes.},

''This is an important book. Our School is vibrant and alive. Sam Chaltain's keen insights and warm, readable prose invite readers to experience the complex, challenging, often frustrating, and occasionally triumphant lives of four caring teachers and their students. I urge you to accept the invitation.''--John Merrow, education correspondent, PBS NewsHour, and president,Learning Matters, Inc.''What Our School shows with passion and precision is that education is about real people leading real lives in real places. If school doesn't engage them, it doesn t work, no matter what the accountants and policymakers may say. That's what this book is really about and why it's so important for anyone who genuinely cares about schools, communities, and their children.''--From the Foreword by Sir Ken Robinson, world-renowned author and educatorAlmost every major American city is experimenting with school choice--a deeply controversial idea that is dramatically reshaping public education. Will the wider array of school options help parents and educators identify better strategies for helping all children learn? Or will the high stakes of the marketplace end up privatizing this most public of institutions? Education activist Sam Chaltain believes that before we can answer these questions, we must put a human face on the modern landscape of teaching and learning. Our School documents a year in the life of two schools in the nation's capital--one a new charter school just opening its doors, the other a neighborhood school that first opened in 1924. Chaltain weaves together the observations and emotions of the people whose lives intersect there, and the triumphs and the challenges they experience. The result is an unsettling, complex portrayal of American public education. Our School is important reading for educational policymakers, administrators, parents, the media, and anyone who aspires to be a teacher.Book Features:* Specific recommendations for creating a healthy, high-functioning school.* A detailed account of what school choice actually looks and feels like to the people who experience it.* A vivid description of the modern classroom and what it's really like to teach in public school.* An important focus on the humanity of teachers (their personal histories, their reasons for entering the profession, their day-to-day challenges).* An intimate look at the inner lives of children (their biggest fears and needs, their moments of triumph and understanding).},

Understanding the extent to which a school or district student population is mobile can lead educational policy makers and leaders to implement strategies to support these particular students so that they do not experience an academic downturn, therefore access to mobility data is critical. Using data from the Connecticut State Department of Education, this research study examines the degree to which student mobility exists within Connecticut, and analyzes student mobility in relation to student achievement.

Fallon said that Manchester, Ellington, Vernon and RHAM high schools have agreed to send students and that he expects Hartford and Somers to do so soon.
Fallon asked the Coventry board to approve sending up to five students to the academy for \$1,000 per student per year, a cost he said is guaranteed for the next four years. The rest of the cost would be covered by money the academy is seeking from state funds allocated by the legislature to bring together students of different races and backgrounds and promote regional education programs, Fallon said.},

“A remarkable new book.... Wise and energetic advocates such as Kahlenberg and Potter can take the charter movement in new and useful directions.”—The~Washington PostMoving beyond the debate over whether or not charter schools should exist,~A Smarter Charter~wrestles with the question of what kind of charter schools we should encourage. The authors begin by tracing the evolution of charter schools from teacher union leader Albert Shanker’s original vision of giving teachers room to innovate while educating a diverse population of students, to today’s charter schools where the majority of teachers are not unionized and student segregation levels are even higher than in traditional public schools. In the second half of the book, the authors examine two key reforms currently seen in a small but growing number of charter schools—teacher voice and socioeconomic integration—that have the potential to improve performance and reshape the stereotypical image of what it means to be a charter school.Important reading for policymakers, educators, researchers, and all citizens interested in the future of America’s public schools,~A Smarter Charter~features:  Profiles of charter schools that are bucking the prevailing trends, including their performance data and the challenges they face.  Best practices from successful charter schools, such as methods for attracting a diverse student body and examples of innovative teacher contracts.  Reform strategies that can improve student outcomes in a variety of public schools, not just charters.“Kahlenberg and Potter have delivered a thought-provoking, serious contribution. Agree or not with their views on the purpose and performance of charter schools, they have important things to say on where charters have been, where they need to go, and how they can get there. Friends and foes of charter schooling, alike, would do well to read this book.”—Frederick M. Hess, resident scholar and director of Education Policy Studies, American Enterprise Institute“Read this book and draw inspiration and ideas from charter schools and educators bucking the trend and reclaiming that original, collaborative, and powerful promise and spirit. I hope parents, educators in all sectors, concerned citizens, policymakers, philanthropists—and charter sector leaders—will take its compelling message to heart and act on it.”—Dennis Van Roekel, former president, National Education Association“A tour-de-force, laying out in singular fashion what has gone wrong with the charter school movement, and what must be done to get it back on track....~A Smarter Charter~is a must-read for those concerned with the future of charter schools and public education.”—Randi Weingarten, president, American Federation of Teachers},

  abstract = {Almost fifty years ago the Coleman Report, widely regarded as the most important educational study of the twentieth century, found that the most powerful predictor of academic achievement is the socioeconomic status of a child's family. The second most important predictor is the socioeconomic status of the classmates in his or her school. Until very recently, the importance of this second finding has been consciously ignored by policymakers, and the national education debate has centered on trying to "fix" high-poverty schools by pouring greater resources into them, paying educators more to teach in them, or turning them into charter schools. At the local level, however, eighty school districts educating four million students now consciously seek to integrate schools by socioeconomic status. The Future of School Integration looks at how socioeconomic school integration has been pursued as a strategy to reduce the proportion of high-poverty schools and therefore to improve the performance of students overall. It examines whether students learn more in socioeconomically integrated schools —and pre-K programs —than in high-poverty institutions and explores the costs and benefits of integration programs. The book also investigates whether such integration is logistically and politically feasible, looking at the promises and pitfalls of both intradistrict and interdistrict integration programs. Finally, it examines the relevance of socioeconomic integration strategies being pursued by states and localities to the ongoing policy debates in Washington over efforts to turn around the nation's lowest-performing schools and to improve the quality of charter schools.Contributors include Stephanie Aberger (Expeditionary Learning), Marco Basile (Harvard University), Jennifer Jellison Holme (University of Texas–Austin), Ann Mantil (Harvard), Anne G.

  abstract = {"It is well recognized that despite its wealthy towns and major corporations, Connecticut, like 
many states, has faced difficult economic times during the Great Recession. The official 
poverty rate of 10 percent reflects only part of the story of financial instability in the state. The 
official U.S. poverty rate, which was developed in 1965, has not been updated since 1974, 
and is not adjusted to reflect cost of living differences across the U.S. A lack of accurate 
measurements and even language to frame a discussion has made it difficult for states – 
including Connecticut – to identify the full extent of the economic challenges that so many of 
their residents face.
This Report presents four groundbreaking instruments that measure the size and condition of 
households struggling financially, and it introduces the term ALICE – Asset Limited, Income 
Constrained, Employed. The Report includes findings on households that earn below the 
ALICE Threshold, a level based on the actual cost of basic household necessities in each 
county in Connecticut. It outlines the role of ALICE households in the state economy, the 
public resources spent on households in crisis, and the implications of struggling households 
for the wider community.
Using the realistic measures of the financial survival threshold for each county in Connecticut, 
the Report reveals a far larger problem than previously identified. Connecticut has 141,628 
households with income below the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) but also has 332,817 ALICE 
households, which have income above the FPL but below the ALICE Threshold. These 
numbers are eye-opening: in total, 474,445 households in Connecticut – fully 35 percent 
– are struggling to support themselves."},

  abstract = {Background \& Purpose: The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) recently released a summary of five CREDO studies of charter school outcomes produced between 2009 and 2013. We compared the WWC’s summary, which highlighted the statistical significance of the findings, to the effect sizes reported in the individual reports. We also addressed the findings reported in the original studies that were not summarized in the WWC reports.

Research Design: Analytic essay highlighting the gaps between the findings reported in the summary WWC report, the individual WWC reports for each study, and the original CREDO studies.

Findings: We argue that focusing on statistical significance is potentially misleading. The WCC summary invites the reader to conclude that charter schools had a greater effect on students’ achievement gains than traditional public schools. Comparing across the studies’ effect sizes suggests that the average effect of charter schools on students’ achievement gains is negligible. The WWC reports also do not address the considerable variation in achievement gains within and across subgroups of students and schools.

Conclusion: Summaries generated from research studies should provide an accounting of findings that allows practitioners to assess their practical importance. When these and similar reports are hard to understand and misleading, they run the risk of eroding practitioners’ trust in research and increasing rather than bridging the gulf between research and practice.},

  abstract = {"Most parents want to raise their children in neighborhoods with good schools, safe streets, and neighbors who support their efforts to raise healthy, happy, and successful families.  Their hopes are well-placed because a growing body of evidence supports two conclusions about how neighborhoods affect children’s well-being.
First, high-poverty neighborhoods, which are often violent, stressful, and environmentally hazardous, can impair children’s cognitive development, school performance, mental health, and long-term physical health.  Second, poor children who live in low-poverty neighborhoods and consistently attend high-quality schools — where more students come from middle- or high-income families and do well academically, parents are more involved, teachers are likely to be more skilled, staff morale is higher, and student turnover is low — perform significantly better academically than those who do not.
Nearly 4 million children live in families that receive federal rental assistance.  This assistance not only helps these families to afford decent, stable housing and make ends meet, but it also has the potential to enable their children to grow up in better neighborhoods and thereby enhance their chances of long-term health and success.  Historically, however, federal rental assistance programs have fallen short in helping families live in neighborhoods that provide these opportunities.
Over several decades, policymakers have adopted measures to reduce the extent to which low-income families receiving federal rental assistance are concentrated in distressed neighborhoods and, instead, to improve these families’ access to safe neighborhoods with good schools, more opportunities for recreation and enrichment, and better access to jobs.  To do so, policymakers have relied increasingly on housing vouchers (rather than housing projects) so that families may choose where to live rather than be limited to government-funded projects that often are situated in very poor, segregated neighborhoods.
Despite these efforts, in 2010 only 15 percent of the children in families that received rent subsidies through the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) three major rental assistance programs — the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, public housing, and Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (as described in Box 1) — lived in low-poverty neighborhoods, where fewer than 10 percent of the residents had incomes below the poverty line.  A greater share of such children (18 percent) lived in extreme-poverty neighborhoods, where at least 40 percent of the residents are poor.[1]   
The HCV program has performed much better than HUD’s project-based rental assistance programs in enabling more low-income families with children — and particularly more African American and Latino families — to live in lower-poverty neighborhoods.  (Only a small share of public housing or privately owned units with project-based rental assistance for families with children are in low-poverty neighborhoods.)  Having a housing voucher also substantially reduces the likelihood of living in an extreme-poverty neighborhood, compared with similar families with children that either receive project-based rental assistance or don’t receive housing assistance at all.

"The Sheff vs. O'Neill lawsuit of 1989 created many diverse public education options for local families. Now is the time to investigate opportunities. The Magnet-Open Choice Lottery, operated by the Greater Hartford Regional School Choice Office (RSCO), opens mid-month, giving Hartford-area students potential access to 40 schools. "I really felt for my boys that they needed a more structured intensive preschool program," says Carolyn Venne, a mom of twins in South Windsor, who entered a past lottery, targeting a Capitol Region Education Council (CREC) magnet school in Bloomfield. Education officials admit it's a complicated process. So, they are increasing communication about these no-cost options hoping to address questions and confusion."
Another mother says "it's like their own little private school"

  abstract = {The political popularity of charter schools is unmistakable. This article explores the relationship between charter schools and segregation across the country, in 40 states, the District of Columbia, and several dozen metropolitan areas with large enrollments of charter school students in 2007-08. The descriptive analysis of the charter school enrollment is aimed at understanding the characteristics of students enrolled in charter schools and the extent to which charter school students are segregated, including how charter school segregation compare to students in traditional public schools. This article examines these questions at different levels, aggregating school-level enrollment to explore patterns among metropolitan areas, states, and the nation using three national datasets. Our findings suggest that charters currently isolate students by race and class. This analysis of recent data finds that charter schools are more racially isolated than traditional public schools in virtually every state and large metropolitan area in the nation. In some regions, white students are overrepresented in charter schools while in other charter schools; minority students have little exposure to white students. Data about the extent to which charter schools serve low-income and English Language Learners is incomplete, but suggest that a substantial share of charter schools may not enroll such students. As charters represent an increasing share of our public schools, they influence the level of segregation experienced by all of our nation's school-aged children. After two decades, the promise of charter schools to use choice to foster integration and equality in American education has yet to be realized. (Contains 50 footnotes, 46 tables and 9 figures.)},

  abstract = {Because most children throughout the world attend elementary and secondary schools near their homes, where they live usually determines where they go to school. In the United States, the relationship between residential location and education has been especially strong given the dominance of local funding and local control of K–12 education. School quality varies markedly among the more than 14,000 school districts across the United States and within many of the country’s large urban districts. Housing prices reflect school quality; houses in better school districts or more advantaged neighborhoods of large districts sell at a premium. In other words, school quality is capitalized into the price of land.The chapters in this volume explore the links between education, location, and land based on the proceedings of the 8th Annual Land Policy Conference of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. Three policy outcomes are the focus: academic achievement of schoolchildren; racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic segregation; and equality of opportunity, all of which have broad relevance to U.S. public policy.~The topics include the expansion of school choice, especially through charter schools and home schooling; the importance of cognitive skills for economic growth; the role of the property tax in school finance and alternative revenue sources; the structure of school districts; transportation to school; effects of school location; and housing policies that can unlink education and location.This volume features the papers presented at the Lincoln Institute's 8th annual Land Policy Conference in June 2013.},

The move would help ease overcrowding at Kennelly, which has about 900 students, but they would be shifting from one of the city's higher-performing schools to one of the lower-performing.
School officials told parents from Barbour School that their children would benefit from being transfered to Wish School, which has higher Connecticut Mastery Test scores than Barbour.

Schools serving student populations that are both low poverty and low minority are 89 times more likely to be consistently high performing compared with high‐poverty, high‐minority schools. This does not mean that schools have no influence over student achievement, or that schools should be unaccountable, but that accountability systems need to have carefully defined objectives and measures of school progress.

The study analyzes the life trajectories of children born between 1945 and 1970, and followed through 2011, using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The PSID data are linked with multiple data sources that describe the neighborhood attributes, school quality resources, and coincident policies that prevailed at the time these children were growing up. I exploit quasirandom variation in the timing of initial court orders, which generated differences in the timing and scope of the implementation of desegregation plans during the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. Event study analyses as well as 2SLS and sibling-difference estimates indicate that school desegregation and the accompanied increases in school quality resulted in significant improvements in adult attainments for blacks. I find that, for blacks, school desegregation significantly increased both educational and occupational attainments, college quality and adult earnings, reduced the probability of incarceration, and improved adult health status; desegregation had no effects on whites across each of these outcomes. The results suggest that the mechanisms through which school desegregation led to beneficial adult attainment outcomes for blacks include improvement in access to school resources reflected in reductions in class size and increases in per-pupil spending.},

As schools were desegregated in the 1950s and 1960s, opponents feared that embracing students from low-performing all-black schools would lower standards and unfairly disrupt white students’ performances. In fact, as Rucker Johnson shows with his extensive research, desegregation had essentially no effect on white students, but propelled minority students to unprecedented levels of success. Rucker Johnson is an Associate Professor in the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley; a Faculty Research Fellow of the National Bureau of Economic Research; and a Research Affiliate of the National Poverty Center and the Institute for Research on Poverty. His research considers the role of poverty and inequality in affecting life chances. He has focused on such topics as the long-run impacts of child neighborhood and school quality on socioeconomic success and later-life health; the determinants of intergenerational mobility; the societal consequences of incarceration; effects of maternal employment patterns on child well-being; the socioeconomic determinants of health disparities over the life course; and the effects of growing up poor and poor infant health on childhood cognition, educational attainment, adult health and economic status.},

That plan is now four years late, magnet schools approved before the moratorium will probably be full by the start of the next school year, research is incomplete on their impact and many legislators are reluctant to open new schools.

Although repeated pretreatment and posttreatment measures of student performance can provide unbiased estimates under relatively weak assumptions, such data are difficult to obtain. The article develops an instrumental variable strategy that can be used to improve on common value-added estimators when only posttreatment measures of performance are available. Using data from New York City, the author shows that the instrumental variable strategy can provide estimates of model impacts similar to those provided by a difference-in-differences estimator provided that appropriate instruments are used.},

Trustees Chairman Robert Furek said the budget request -- developed by former schools chief Matthew Borrelli and endorsed by new Superintendent Anthony S.

Furek said it was based on real needs, not the guesswork that had led the trustees to chop then- Superintendent Patricia Daniel'sbudget request last year.
The trustees stood by a controversial redistricting plan that would close Barbour Elementary School and send its 140 students to Wish School. The plan also would send some Kennelly School students to Hooker School, some West Middle students to King and Barnard- Brown, and some Parkville and Moylan students to McDonough.

  abstract = {School choice policies, a fixture of efforts to improve public education in many cities, aim to enable families to choose a school that they believe will best meet their child's needs. In New York City (NYC), choice and the development of a diverse portfolio of options have played central roles in the Department of Education's high school reform efforts. This report examines the choices and placements of New York City's lowest-achieving students: those scoring among the bottom 20 percent on standardized state tests in middle school. Focusing on data from 2007 to 2011, the report looks at who these low-achieving students are, including how their demographics compare to other students in NYC, the educational challenges they face, and where they live. The bulk of the report reviews low-achieving students' most preferred schools and the ones to which they were ultimately assigned, assessing how these schools compare to those of their higher-achieving peers. The findings show that low-achieving students attended schools that were lower performing, on average, than those of all other students. This was driven by differences in students' initial choices: low-achieving students' first-choice schools were less selective, lower-performing, and more disadvantaged. Overall, lower-achieving and higher-achieving students were matched to their top choices at the same rate. Importantly, both low- and higher-achieving students appear to prefer schools that are close to home, suggesting that differences in students' choices likely reflect, at least in part, the fact that lower-achieving students are highly concentrated in poor neighborhoods, where options may be more limited. Two appendixes present: (1) The Shrinking Pool of Level 1 and Level 2 Students; and (2) Supplemental Tables and Figures. (Contains 30 endnotes, 26 figures, and 6 tables.)},

"Jeffrey Henig’s book, Spin Cycle: How Research is Used in Policy Debates: The Case of Charter Schools, investigates the causes of the politicization of charter school research. The impetus for his book is an article appearing on the front page, “above the fold,” of the New York Times, in August 2004. The article described a report released, as an exclusive to the Times, by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) on the performance of charter schools. The AFT report detailed National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) test results comparing charter schools to regular public schools obtained from the U.S. Department of Education’s website. The Times article began, “The first national comparison of test scores among children in charter schools and regular public schools shows charter school students often doing worse than comparable students in regular public schools” (Schemo, 2004, as quoted in Henig, pp. 1-2). The article went on, Henig says, to imply “that the Bush administration, which was a vocal and active proponent of charter schools, had tried to suppress the evidence” (p. 2). Its prominent publication set off a chain of subsequent events, beginning with a full-page advertisement in the following day’s Times, signed by well known researchers, criticizing the research methods used in the report and, by implication, the Times’ coverage of it. The politicized chain of events then continued with an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, the rushed release of additional charter schools research, and a general degradation of civility among some researchers and activists involved the issue. As one advocate commented, “all hell broke loose” (Petrilli, quoted in Henig, p. 3)"},

In response to President Obama's May 5th through May 11th 2013 “National Charter Schools Week” proclamation, and his call for the nation's support of highly performing charter schools, the author analyzes the schools' demographic profiles, using data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the Common Core of Data (CCD), and the Arizona Department of Education (ADE). The author also explores current public discourses surrounding the two charter school organizations. The findings are relevant and timely in light of Obama’s call to extend and replicate successful charter schools throughout the United States, because the results problematize the definition and nuances of charter school “success” by considering the study’s schools in relation to their underrepresentation of disadvantaged students. Based on evidence discovered in the study, the author provides relevant policy questions and suggestions for local, state, and federal education policymakers."

  abstract = {"Background/Context: Charter school policy has evolved into a major component of the current education reform movement in the United States. As of 2012, all but nine U.S. states allowed charter schools, and in one of those nine, Washington State, charter school legislation was passed by popular vote in November 2012. There is a substantial, if contested, research base focusing on charter school effectiveness, particularly related to test score achievement, as well as an equally contested literature base on charter school enrollment selectivity, student expulsions, and increased segregation in charter school populations.
Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyze the network of relations of policy actors surrounding the statewide campaign to pass the charter school Initiative 1240 in Washington State in order to better understand how wealthy individuals and their associated philanthropic organizations influence educational policy.

Research Design: Making use of available tax records, public election information, individual and organizational websites, and institutional and foundation databases, this study uses simple directed graphing techniques from social network analysis to analyze the complex relationships and affiliations of policy actors relative to the campaign to pass charter school Initiative 1240 in the state of Washington.

Conclusions/Recommendations: This study concludes that, compared to the average voter in Washington, an elite group of wealthy individuals, either directly through individual donations or indirectly through their affiliated philanthropic organizations, wielded disproportionate influence over the outcome of the charter school initiative in the state, thereby raising serious concerns about the democratic underpinnings of an education policy that impacts all of the children in Washington State. This study also concludes that elite individuals make use of local nonprofit organizations as a mechanism to advance their education policy agenda by funding those nonprofits through the philanthropic organizations affiliated with those same wealthy elites. In light of these conclusions, the authors recommend that a mechanism for more democratic accountability be developed relative to education policy campaigns, initiatives, and legislation."},

Simmons-Harris ruling. Utilizing an Advocacy Coalition Framework, questions about the ideological motivations behind different forms of school choice, the particular programs that certain groups are likely to support or oppose, and the strategies—including the potential alliances and coalitions—that are increasingly employed around school choice policy are explored. A framework for understanding and analyzing policymaking in this area is offered, extending existing thinking on both school choice issues and education policy more generally.},

The premise is that competitive incentives will change the organizational behavior of schools (and districts, dioceses, etc.) in ways that will lead to more equitable access for students across varied and often segregated urban landscapes. Drawing from theories of institutional environments and nonprofit firms, this analysis investigates patterns of access across three highly competitive local education markets to determine how school choices are arranged as options expand. The findings indicate that competitive incentives can have similar impacts on different types of organizations, but both policy variations and contextual factors such as demographic distributions may also play critical roles in shaping the market structures in which schools operate. Notably, all three cases showed patterns of exclusionary strategies that schools embraced to enhance market position.},

It is also neighborhood and community. Using two conceptions of geography—space and place—I investigate how and when geography factored into parents’ thinking. Drawing on spatial analyses of parents’ choice sets, the schools within two miles of their homes, and longitudinal in‐depth interviews, I describe a range of ways in which geography shaped 36 parents’ choices of middle and high schools in Detroit. Parents considered a small fraction of the schools near their homes; however, all the parents discussed geographic characteristics of schools. The role geography played in the choice process ranged from nonexistent to framing. By investigating how parents’ geographic preferences played out with respect to their other preferences and the existing supply of schools, this study contributes to the field’s increasingly nuanced understanding of parents’ decision making.},

In particular, they show how the evolution of the charter movement has shaped research questions and findings.By highlighting what we know about the conditions for success in charter schools, the authors make a significant contribution to current debates in policy and practice, both within the charter sector and in the larger landscape of public education.},

Their presence can bring long-needed material resources to such schools, but, as Linn Posey-Maddox shows in this study, it can also introduce new class and race tensions, and even exacerbate inequalities. Sensitively navigating the pros and cons of middle-class transformation, When Middle-Class Parents Choose Urban Schools asks whether it is possible for our urban public schools to have both financial security and equitable diversity. ~~~~~~~~~~~ Drawing on in-depth research at an urban elementary school, Posey-Maddox examines parents’ efforts to support the school through their outreach, marketing, and volunteerism. She shows that when middle-class parents engage in urban school communities, they can bring a host of positive benefits, including new educational opportunities and greater diversity. But their involvement can also unintentionally marginalize less-affluent parents and diminish low-income students’ access to the improving schools. In response, Posey-Maddox argues that school reform efforts, which usually equate improvement with rising test scores and increased enrollment, need to have more equity-focused policies in place to ensure that low-income families also benefit from—and participate in—school change.},

'School choice' is a slogan being voiced around the globe, conjuring images of a marketplace with an abundance of educational options. Those promoting educational choice also promise equality, social advantage, autonomy, and self-expression to families. But what does this globalisation of school choice actually look like on the ground? This collection brings together educationalists, anthropologists, and sociologists who use a rich array of empirical data to understand the complex realities of school choice across a range of political and social settings: in Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, England, India, Israel, Japan, Singapore, Tanzania, and the United States. Together they show that, while the language of school choice has spread globally, it has done so unevenly across and within nations, and is always interpreted through local social and historical contexts. Neo-liberal policy initiatives are re-shaping education systems in many nations, but in complex and varied ways. This collection shows that rather than eliminating equity concerns, they re-embed them within new frameworks of choice and accountability. This is an important book for those interested in comparative education, as well as the sociology and politics of schooling. CONTENTS Acknowledgements Martin Forsey, Scott Davies \& Geoffrey Walford.

To complement existing work, we assess research on the educational and social outcomes for comparable youth who change school and neighborhood settings through unique housing policy and school voucher programs. Research shows that housing programs have helped poor families move to much safer, less disadvantaged, and less segregated neighborhoods. Some housing programs have also provided early educational benefits for young people who relocated to less poor and less segregated neighborhoods, but these gains were not maintained in the long run. School voucher programs have helped disadvantaged youth attend higher-performing private schools in less segregated environments with more middle-class peers. Although some voucher programs have shown small positive effects, the results of others are less certain owing to methodological weaknesses. Future research should directly examine families’ selection processes and be cautious with quantitative research that uses naturally occurring variation to model the effects of potential social programs. Researchers should also recognize the family processes that interact with social policy to determine how youth development can be improved, alongside the structural and political processes that condition how programs work at a larger scale.},

  abstract = {This book tells the story of one mans life journey into the heart of the struggle to reform the nations schools. Fuller has always believed that it is important for poor and working class Black people to gain access to the levers of power dictating their lives. He believes that those of us who are educated and resourceful have a moral and historical responsibility to help them, and that is what he has always tried to do. Early in his life he found truth in the words of the great Frederick Douglass: 'Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did, and it never will.' \textasciitilde{} 'So struggle we must' says Fuller. That understanding of the relationship between struggle and progress is what propelled him down dark alleys and dirt roads in some of North Carolinas poorest communities in the 1960s and pushed him into the bush, mountains, and war-torn villages of Africa nearly a decade later. \textasciitilde{} 'It is what pushes me still in the fight over one of the most contentious education issues of this era: parental choice. I believe deep in my heart that giving low-income and working class parents the power (and the money) to make choices about the schools their children attend will not only revolutionize education but provide the compass to a better life for the many poor, Black children stuck in failing systems. ... Education reform is one of the most crucial social justice issues of our time, and I will spend the rest of my days fighting for my people, most especially those without the power or the resources to fight for themselves.'},

Opportunity and achievement, while inextricably connected, are very different goals. Every American will not go to college, but every American should be given a fair chance to be prepared for college. In communities across the U.S., children lack the crucial resources and opportunities, inside and outside of schools that they need if they are to reach their potential.  Closing the Opportunity Gap offers accessible, research-based essays written by top experts who highlight the discrepancies that exist in our public schools, focusing on how policy decisions and life circumstances conspire to create the "opportunity gap" that leads inexorably to stark achievement gaps. They also describe sensible policies grounded in evidence that can restore and enhance opportunities. Moving beyond conventional academic discourse, Closing the Opportunity Gap will spark vital new conversations about what schools, parents, educators, and policymakers can and should do to give all children a fair chance to thrive.},

  isbn = {978-0-8157-2390-5},
  url = {http://confrontingsuburbanpoverty.org/},
  abstract = {It has been nearly a half century since President Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty. Back in the 1960s tackling poverty "in place" meant focusing resources in the inner city and in rural areas. The suburbs were seen as home to middle- and upper-class families —affluent commuters and homeowners looking for good schools and safe communities in which to raise their kids. But today's America is a very different place. Poverty is no longer just an urban or rural problem, but increasingly a suburban one as well. In Confronting Suburban Poverty in America, Elizabeth Kneebone and Alan Berube take on the new reality of metropolitan poverty and opportunity in America.After decades in which suburbs added poor residents at a faster pace than cities, the 2000s marked a tipping point. Suburbia is now home to the largest and fastest-growing poor population in the country and more than half of the metropolitan poor. However, the antipoverty infrastructure built over the past several decades does not fit this rapidly changing geography. As Kneebone and Berube cogently demonstrate, the solution no longer fits the problem.The spread of suburban poverty has many causes, including shifts in affordable housing and jobs, population dynamics, immigration, and a struggling economy. The phenomenon raises several daunting challenges, such as the need for more (and better) transportation options, services, and financial resources. But necessity also produces opportunity —in this case, the opportunity to rethink and modernize services, structures, and procedures so that they work in more scaled, cross-cutting, and resource-efficient ways to address widespread need. This book embraces that opportunity.Kneebone and Berube paint a new picture of poverty in America as well as the best ways to combat it. Confronting Suburban Poverty in America offers a series of workable recommendations for public, private, and nonprofit leaders seeking to modernize poverty alleviation and community development strategies and connect residents with economic opportunity. The authors highlight efforts in metro areas where local leaders are learning how to do more with less and adjusting their approaches to address the metropolitan scale of poverty —for example, integrating services and service delivery, collaborating across sectors and jurisdictions, and using data-driven and flexible funding strategies."We believe the goal of public policy must be to provide all families with access to communities, whether in cities or suburbs, that offer a high quality of life and solid platform for upward mobility over time. Understanding the new reality of poverty in metropolitan America is a critical step toward realizing that goal." —from Chapter One},

  abstract = {The case of school reform in Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, NC, illustrates the trend away from desegregation policies \& toward parental choice. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district was desegregated during the 1970s, partially through forced busing. During the 1980s, Charlotte elites abandoned support for busing, \& in 1992, mandatory busing was replaced with a voluntary system based on magnet schools, fulfilling the wishes of most white \& some African-American parents. The abandonment of active desegregation occurred in a national context of criticism of desegregation, criticism of public education in general, attacks on the poor by the Right, middle class fears of economic restructuring \& decline, \& the redefinition of at-risk children as social problems. Local concerns focused on maximizing educational benefits for middle class children \& creating a climate that would attract business to the area. 1 Table, 3 Figures, 73 References. E. Blackwell},

  abstract = {Since the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, researchers and policy makers have paid close attention to trends in school segregation. Here we review the evidence regarding trends and consequences of both racial and economic school segregation since Brown. The evidence suggests that the most significant declines in black-white school segregation occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s. There is disagreement about the direction of more recent trends in racial segregation, largely driven by how one defines and measures segregation. Depending on the definition used, segregation has either increased substantially or changed little, although there are important differences in the trends across regions, racial groups, and institutional levels. Limited evidence on school economic segregation makes documenting trends difficult, but students appear to be more segregated by income across schools and districts today than in 1990. We also discuss the role of desegregation litigation, demographic changes, and residential segregation in shaping trends in both racial and economic segregation. We develop a general conceptual model of how and why school segregation might affect students and review the relatively thin body of empirical evidence that explicitly assesses the consequences of school segregation. We conclude with a discussion of aspects of school segregation on which further research is needed.},

demonstrated improvements for all student subgroups on both the CMT and CAPT, as well as smaller
disparities in the achievement between subgroups as compared to the state. These achievements
have occurred in spite of the fact that many students do not have a complete K-12 education within
the CREC system because enrollment in a CREC magnet school is based on a lottery system. (See data highlights in executive summary.)},

  abstract = {From AH Education Matters 19 Feb 2015: "The academic progress of Hartford students from Grade 3 to Grade 8 shows
growth – especially at Grade 6 – before a drop-off in Grades 7 and 8,
according to a new mini-report issued on Achieve Hartford's newly launched
SMARTERHartford.org website. But that’s not all it shows.
Looking at the results from three cohorts of students on the CT Mastery Test (CMT), the mini-report
examined data for Hartford children who began taking the CMT in 2005-2006, 2006-2007, and 2007-
2008, respectively, to see how much they progressed year over year until eighth grade. The three
groups were not matched cohorts – that is, attrition data were not available to account for migration of
students from school to school or new arrivals at schools during the years examined. Yet, at a high level,
the data for these last three cohorts to take the CMT, before its discontinuation in 2013, do show modest
increases through Grade 5 and larger increases at Grade 6, before a drop-off at Grades 7 and 8.
While the academic velocity of individual Hartford schools has wide variability, magnet schools typically
see more growth over the years and have higher levels of performance than do neighborhood schools –
but not in all cases, especially when you break out the performance of only Hartford students at magnet
schools.
The drop-off in performance from Grade 6 to Grade 8 is a major concern, as it negates much of what
students were able to gain from Grade 3 to Grade 6 – and makes it nearly impossible to close the
achievement gap with the State average by high school graduation. It also comes at a crucial time, just
before the transition to high school.
The detailed results in the full mini-report are available here. Academic velocity findings at each
individual school are fascinating – but mostly as they relate to the variability of each school’s
performance, given that the cohort data we have do not account for migration of students from one
school to another."},

Hartford magnet schools. Yet the recent stretch run by Hartford magnets on the CMT, closing the CRECHartford
Host magnet gap from 19.3 points in 2007 to 5.1 points in 2013, reflected significant
improvements in HPS magnet scores. Overall proficiency at the high school level has been very close

  abstract = {This history of the idea of “neighborhood” in a major American city examines the transition of Atlanta, Georgia, from a place little concerned with residential segregation, tasteful surroundings, and property control to one marked by extreme concentrations of poverty and racial and class exclusion. Using Atlanta as a lens to view the wider nation, LeeAnn Lands shows how assumptions about race and class have coalesced with attitudes toward residential landscape aesthetics and home ownership to shape public policies that promote and protect white privilege. Lands studies the diffusion of property ideologies on two separate but related levels: within academic, professional, and bureaucratic circles and within circles comprising civic elites and rank-and-file residents. By the 1920s, following the establishment of park neighborhoods such as Druid Hills and Ansley Park, white home owners approached housing and neighborhoods with a particular collection of desires and sensibilities: architectural and landscape continuity, a narrow range of housing values, orderliness, and separation from undesirable land uses—and undesirable people. By the 1950s, these desires and sensibilities had been codified in federal, state, and local standards, practices, and laws. Today, Lands argues, far more is at stake than issues of access to particular neighborhoods, because housing location is tied to the allocation of a broad range of resources, including school funding, infrastructure, and law enforcement. Long after racial segregation has been outlawed, white privilege remains embedded in our culture of home ownership.},

  abstract = {Bernard Madoff 's investor fraud took the Ponzi scheme to a new level, but it wasn't so long ago that Connecticut had its own infamous fraud case tied to some of  Hartford 's most well-known real estate: Colonial Realty Co.
Throughout much of the 1980s, Colonial three partners — Jonathan N. Googel, Benjamin J. Sisti and Frank M. Shuch — sold \$350 million worth of shares in various real estate syndication deals. Colonial would purchase the properties with bank financing, then seek investors. In return, investors would earn dividends and, in theory, could sell their shares in a specified number of years.
What investigators later found out was something quite different: The deals were designed to generate commissions and bank loans for Colonial's top brass, but not profits for investors.},

They got a law passed — the "Black Law" — in May 1833 forbidding "any person" to "set up or establish in this state any school, academy or literary institution for the instruction of colored persons who are not inhabitants of this state." In Canterbury, the church bells rang and cannons fired in celebration near the academy's doors.

A month later, Crandall was charged with violating the law. Three trials followed, with Crandall spending one night in jail. A lower-court conviction was overturned on a technicality in the Supreme Court of Errors. Crandall's stand won her tributes — and gifts of commemorative crockery — from as far away as the British Isles},

When Crandall accepted a black woman as a student, she unleashed a storm of controversy that catapulted her to national notoriety, and drew the attention of the most significant pro- and anti-slavery activists of the day. The Connecticut state legislature passed its infamous Black Law in an attempt to close down her school. Arrested and jailed, Crandall’s legal legacy had a lasting impact—Crandall v. State was the first full-throated civil rights case in U.S. history. The arguments by attorneys in Crandall played a role in two of the most fateful Supreme Court decisions, Dred Scott v. Sandford, and the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education. In Prudence Crandall’s Legacy, author and lawyer Donald E. Williams Jr. marshals a wealth of detail concerning the life and work of Prudence Crandall, her unique role in the fight for civil rights, and her influence on legal arguments for equality in America.},

Sec. 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives, in General Assembly convened, That no person shall set up or establish in this State, any school, academy, or literary institution, for the instruction or education of colored persons who are not inhabitants of this State, nor instruct or teach in any school, academy, or literary Institution whatsoever in this State, or harbor. or board, for the purpose of attending or being taught or instructed in any such school, academy or literary institution, any colored person who is not an inhabitant of any town in this state, without the consent, in writing, first obtained of a majority of the civil authority, and also of the select men of the town in which such school, academy, or literary institution is situated; and each and every person who shall knowingly do any act forbidden as aforesaid, or shall be aiding or assisting therein; shall, for the first offence, forfeit and pay to the treasurer of state, a fine of one hundred dollars, and for the second offence shall forfeit and pay a fine of two hundred dollars, and so double for every offence of which he or she shall be convicted.

Provided, That nothing in this act shall extend to any district school established in any school society, under the laws of this state, or to any incorporated academy or incorporated school for instruction in this state.
Sec. 2. Be it further enacted, That any colored person, not an inhabitant of this state, who shall reside in any town therein for the purpose of being instructed as aforesaid, may be removed in the manner prescribed in the sixth and seventh sections of the act to which this is in addition.
Sec. 3. Be it further enacted, That any person, not an inhabitant of this state, who shall reside in any town therein, for the purpose of being instructed as aforesaid, shall be an admissible witness in all prosecutions under the first section of this act, and may be compelled to give testimony therein, notwithstanding any thing contained in this act, or the act last aforesaid.

Relative Economic Stability  40 B Proection from Adverse Influences  20 C Freedom from Special Hazards  5 D Adequacy of Civic, Social, and Commercial Centers 5 E Adequacy of Transportation  10 F Sufficiency of Utilities and conveniences 5 G Leve of Taxes and Special Assessments  5 H Appeal  10 Part D, Section 951: Quality and Accessibilty of Schools . . .

plaintiffs and local residents who supported the change and those who worked with them. (I was
a witness in the initial trial and learned a great deal about Hartford and the state’s schools and
school policy and about the communities with the metro at the time). After a long wait, the
Connecticut Supreme Court reviewed the massive record in the case and made some very
important findings. The Court held that the state had an obligation to pursue integrated schools
and that those rights extended beyond municipal boundaries. In fact, the state court found that a
system of district boundaries that segregated students and made integration almost impossible
were themselves in violation of the state constitution. But, it charged the legislature with coming
up with a solution. What followed were modest initial steps and years of back and forth efforts to
develop solutions that worked through choice process and to gain the resources to implement.
The efforts have not eliminated segregation or ended racial achievement gaps but it is the only
state in the Northeast that is going in a positive direction and it has created voluntary processes
that have clearly reduced severe segregation in a time devoid of national leadership. This is a
solid accomplishment that the state should be proud of and other states should look at as an
example.},

  title = {Examining the ({{De}}){{Merger}} of the {{Memphis City}} and {{Shelby County School Systems}}},
  abstract = {On August 5, 2013, roughly 150,000 students began their first day of class in Tennessee’s recently merged Memphis City and Shelby County school system. This August, a subset of students will bypass the consolidated district and enroll in one of the six new suburban school systems created in the aftermath of the merger. This paper explores what happened in the intervening year—in addition to how the initial merger came about—as a means of understanding the role school district boundary lines play in structuring educational inequality.
District boundaries help give shape to widespread patterns of school segregation; indeed most segregation today is between districts (Clotfelter, 2004; Reardon \& Yun, 2005). Most metropolitan areas are characterized by multiple school systems that differ widely in their racial and socioeconomic makeup, as well as their students’ access to educational resources. Political boundaries separating school districts communicate crucial information to families and stakeholders about the related domains of school quality, property taxes and housing prices (Holme \& Finnigan, 2013; Rothwell, 2012; Ryan, 2010). As a result, the decision to either define school communities broadly or narrowly has extremely important implications for the distribution of equal educational opportunities.
This analysis grows out of a larger, mixed methods case study of consolidation and fragmentation in the Memphis metro. Relying on approximately 20 semi-structured qualitative interviews with education stakeholders in the area, including members of the Shelby County Transition Planning Commission and Shelby County Schools Board of Education, along with superintendents, attorneys, central office personnel, civil rights activists, local policymakers, representatives of parents’ groups, and community organizations, we examine the political process behind the city-suburban merger, subsequent decisions about student assignment and resource distribution and the motivation for the swift creation of six breakaway districts on the fringe of the metro area. All interviews are audio recorded and transcribed directly after they occur. We utilize NVivo to code our interview data and other documents collected using codes derived from the literature on school district consolidation, fragmentation, segregation, and political processes, as well as additional codes that emerge from the data. Findings are checked and re-checked utilizing member checking with participants and our research team to ensure that interpretations of data are consistent with the data and that the conclusions are authentic (Miles \& Huberman, 1994). This iterative process of data analysis allows us to engage in a reflexive process that is inductive and open-ended (Miles \& Huberman, 1994). 
Unpacking the politics surrounding the merger and fragmentation of districts in the Memphis area is critical to advancing our understanding of precisely how decisions about school-related boundary lines are made. In a time of rising inequality and rapid racial diversification, providing all students with equal educational opportunities is increasingly urgent. This study of the political process and early impact of a recent, wide-scale district consolidation, along with the subsequent fragmentation of several outlying suburban communities, will inform education policymakers and practitioners in Memphis and elsewhere.},

  title = {Understanding the {{Diversity}} and {{Equity}} of a {{New Generation}} of {{Controlled School Choice Policies}}},
  abstract = {Rationale: Student assignment policies (SAPs) in K-12 schools can either reproduce or help ameliorate existing inequality. Some districts are trying to maintain voluntarily-adopted integration policies despite the Supreme Court’s most recent decision, which prohibited most race-conscious school choice policies that were the effective and popular ways of accomplishing integration. While alternative policies with minimal or no use of race are still permitted, it is unclear whether they will create diverse schools. This research examines the new generation of school choice policies post-Parents Involved to understand how they affect diversity and equity in our multiracial, yet increasingly race-neutral era. 

Research questions are:
To what extent are schools racially and economically diverse before and after the “new generation” of controlled choice policies? 
Are there differences by student characteristics in who gets their school choices under the new SAPs? How does receiving a top school choice predict who enrolls? 

I analyze the controlled choice policies of Jefferson County, Kentucky, which considers the racial and socioeconomic characteristics of students’ Census block group instead of individual characteristics in determining students’ assignment. 

Theoretical Rationale: SAPs are designed to change the composition of students in schools. SAPs that have voluntary integration have two aims: 1) to reduce racially isolated schools because these schools have fewer educational resources that matter for students’ learning (Linn \& Welner, 2007); and 2) to create diverse schools, which has long-term perpetuating outcomes for students (Pettigrew \& Tropp, 2006; Wells \& Crain, 1994). 

School choice is increasingly popular but choice-only policies tend to produce further stratification (APA Brief, 2006; Dougherty, et al., 2013; Hastings, Kane, and Staiger, 2010; Orfield, 2013), but choice policies can be designed in ways that further integration (see Author, 2013; Betts, et al., 2006). Options remain for districts to pursue voluntary integration through a “new generation” of controlled choice policies that do not use an individual’s racial identity for school assignment (Author, 2011; Reardon, Yun, \& Kurlaender, 2006). Though SES plans or geography-based plans may create more diverse schools than policies not considering either set of characteristics, they are not as successful at producing racial integration as individual race-based plans (Reardon et al., 2006; Reardon \& Rhodes, 2011; Richards, et al., 2012). 

Methods: I employ quantitative methods to analyze data from Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) from 2006-07 to present. I use data from the NCES Common Core of Data to calculate school-level racial segregation using several measures: concentration, exposure and information theory index. Additionally, I analyze de-identified student level data from JCPS students’ applications and subsequent enrollment. I estimate logistic regression models before and after the policy change predicting whether students were granted their first choice or not and to examine whether individual characteristics or receipt of first choice school make students likelier to enroll. 

Significance: This analysis provides useful evidence about the efficacy of new types of choice policies that aim to create diverse, equitable schools under new legal constraints. It also enhances our understanding of the evolving relationships among race, SES, and educational inequality.},

  title = {Changing {{Student Assignment}} in the {{Boston Public Schools}}},
  abstract = {Boston was under a desegregation order from 1974 to 1990. The city continued controlled choice for elementary and middle school, with racial balance criteria until 1999, when it dropped the racial-balance criteria but continued choice. In the system that was in place through the 2013-14 school year, students chose schools within three large zones, and with priority for 50\% of each school’s seats for students who lived within walking distance. Many Bostonians were unsatisfied with the system, because they could not predict where their children would be enrolled, and because students often had long bus rides to schools that were not necessarily better or more diverse than their other options would have been. However, efforts to change the student assignment policy in 2004 and 2009 failed because participants could not agree on a better system. This impasse ended in 2013, when the Boston School Committee voted to eliminate all school zones and instead use a computer algorithm for student assignment. The algorithm generates a set of choices for each address in the city, which includes the 6 closest schools and then pulls in more distant schools if necessary to ensure that each choice set includes at least 2 schools in the city’s top performance quartile and 2 in the second quartile (Boston Public Schools 2013).

This paper is grounded in prior research on the politics of race and urban schooling (Henig et al,. 1999; Author, in press) in mayor-controlled school districts (Henig \& Rich, 2004). We examine why the stalemate over Boston student assignment ended, and why the city adopted this particular, innovative approach to student assignment. Data for the analysis are drawn from interviews with participants, media accounts, and observation of public meetings connected with the process. We conclude that three factors enabled approval of the new policy. First, because the new policy uses a choice algorithm rather than attendance zones, its effects on access to better schools were harder to predict in advance, and less immediately visible. Earlier proposals had redrawn lines on a map, which made it quite visible that students in some neighborhoods would have less access to better-performing schools. Second, many participants believed that promoting diversity in schools (one of the goals of the previous policy) was no longer a relevant goal in a school system whose students are 87\% students of color. Finally, getting students into schools closer to their homes had long been a goal of the city’s popular mayor, who was in his final term. The paper’s main contribution is to analyze how race-blind policies may perpetuate racial inequality; it also illustrates the complexity of racial issues in a mayorally controlled school district.},

  abstract = {Background/Context: Over the past several decades, the structure of school segregation has changed significantly. In the past, students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds tended to be separated into different buildings within school districts; increasingly, however, students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds are likely to be separated into entirely separate districts (Clotfelter, 2004). This growing problem of between-district segregation poses a unique set of challenges for districts and policymakers seeking to advance integration, as districts have administrative authority only over policies that cover their own boundaries. The changing configuration of school segregation, therefore, requires a better understanding of, and more creative solutions aimed at, this policy problem.
Focus of Study: This article explores the dilemmas created by between-district segregation and school district fragmentation in terms of efforts to diversify schools. In our analysis, we examine four predominant approaches that have been used in city governance reform to address the problems of municipal fragmentation: annexation, consolidation, mobility programs, and metropolitan governance reform. Within each section, we examine the potential of each of these approaches as a solution to the problems associated with school district fragmentation.

Data Collection and Analysis: We first review existing research to examine what is known empirically about between-district segregation, and the role of school district fragmentation as a contributing factor. We then review literature about policy efforts to address problems caused by fragmentation in noneducational domains.

Conclusions: Each of the policy efforts discussed in this article offer insights as to potential policy directions to improve integration and address the costs of fragmentation. We conclude by considering the types of structures that could serve as potential vehicles for school districts to address the problems of fragmentation, and by discussing how regional cooperation between school districts can incentivized.},

These collaborative arrangements address two inter-related demographic shifts: the rising level of segregation in public schools and the shift from within district segregation to between-district segregation. This article examines three regional collaboratives (Rochester, NY, Omaha, NE, and Minneapolis, MN) that involve varying degrees of cooperation, funding, and legal force. Drawing on 60 in-depth interviews across the three sites, this analysis considers how each program’s design features interact with local political dynamics to shape the degree to which these collaboratives are able to achieve policy goals.},

The United States, countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Brazil, India, South Africa, and other multiethnic democratic nation-states have increasingly diverse demographic profiles that present challenges and opportunities for social cohesion. The focus of this chapter is the relationship between integrated schooling and social cohesion in nations such as these. The chapter’s central thesis is that schools that are racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse lead to educational outcomes that undergird the attitudinal antecedents to and structural conditions for social cohesion in multiethnic, democratic societies. Using the United States as a case study, the chapter synthesizes educational, social, and behavioral science research on the effects of school racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic status (SES) composition on various adult life course outcomes that are crucial to this condition. It is necessary to explore this topic using the United States as a case study because the English language literature on integrated schooling, life course outcomes, and social cohesion in other multiethnic democracies is rather limited.
Before reviewing the relevant literature on this relationship, it is necessary to problematize the concepts of democracy and social cohesion, both of which have multiple contested meanings. We do not employ the constructs of democracy and social cohesion uncritically. Although a full explication of the nuanced and complicated nature of the debates surrounding social cohesion and democracy is not possible in this chapter, it is important to acknowledge that simplistic conceptualizations of either democracy or social cohesion obscure—rather than illuminate—the social forces under consideration.},

  abstract = {[After the 2007 PICS decision] sent mixed messages to school districts across the country.
To help school districts navigate the legally uncertain environment, the federal government created a small, one-time competitive grant called the Technical Assistance for Student Assignment Plan (TASAP) grant. The grant was designed in a way that gave school districts significant discretion over the types of technical assistance and the consultants that would support their projects.
Eleven school districts received funding from the TASAP grant. The districts faced common challenges, in
particular, financial austerity, declining enrollments, and pressure to reduce achievement gaps between racial
and socioeconomic groups. The most common topics of technical assistance were public engagement, including marketing and community forums, and geospatial analysis. Most of the districts that used TASAP funds to continue existing policies maintained an emphasis on diversity. On the other hand, most of the districts that used TASAP to help change their student assignment policies moved away from diversity as a priority. Districts that had expressed a commitment to diversity in their TASAP applications could not necessarily sustain those commitments in the face of competition with other local interests and needs. Federal management of the grant did not provide leverage on districts to ensure that the local work remained true to its initial goals.
We present six recommendations for future federal diversity policy, based on the TASAP experience:
1. Construct a more deliberate theory of change
so that all elements of the grant, including the proposal evaluation criteria and funded activities, are aligned.
2. Solicit grant proposals for a longer period of time.
3. Include inter-district approaches to diversity.
4. Provide sufficient federal involvement and guidance
to support project implementation at the local level, and increase accountability for federal program goals.
5. Build on local capacity.
6. Situate diversity as central to educational
improvement to increase the relevance of diversity programs.},

This article presents case studies of politics and student assignment policy in three large school districts: Boston, Massachusetts; Wake County (Raleigh), North Carolina; and Jefferson County (Louisville), Kentucky. In all three districts, there has been pressure to change student-assignment policies in ways that respond to the priorities of White and middle-class populations, with the potential to worsen the options available to students of color. Our case studies reinforce the criticisms of race-neutral politics and policy that have been made by Eduardo Bonilla-Silva and others. Race-neutral politics during fiscal retrenchment tends to reframe privilege as common sense and to obscure some students’ structural disadvantages.},

  abstract = {In August 2014, a Ferguson, Missouri, policeman shot and killed an unarmed black teenager. Michael Brown’s
death and the resulting protests and racial tension brought considerable attention to that town. Observers who had
not been looking closely at our evolving demographic patterns were surprised to see ghetto conditions we had
come to associate with inner cities now duplicated in a formerly white suburban community: racially segregated neighborhoods
with high poverty and unemployment, poor student achievement in overwhelmingly black schools, oppressive
policing, abandoned homes, and community powerlessness.
Media accounts of how Ferguson became Ferguson have typically explained that when African Americans moved to
this suburb (and others like it), “white flight” followed, abandoning the town to African Americans who were trying to
escape poor schools in the city. The conventional explanation adds that African Americans moved to a few places like
Ferguson, not the suburbs generally, because prejudiced real estate agents steered black homebuyers away from other
white suburbs. And in any event, those other suburbs were able to preserve their almost entirely white, upper-middleclass
environments by enacting zoning rules that required only expensive single family homes, the thinking goes.
No doubt, private prejudice and suburbanites’ desire for homogenous affluent environments contributed to segregation
in St. Louis and other metropolitan areas. But these explanations are too partial, and too conveniently excuse public
policy from responsibility. A more powerful cause of metropolitan segregation in St. Louis and nationwide has been the
explicit intents of federal, state, and local governments to create racially segregated metropolises.},

In May 1976, the Capitol Region Education Council received a grant from the Connecticut State Department of Education to implement a design for the evaluation of the 1975-76 Hartford Project Concern Program. Due to budgetary and time constraints, it was decided to focus upon two crucial areas, the cognitive and affective impact of Project Concern on program participants. A basic decision was made to evaluate student cognitive growth using a standardized commercially available reading test. It was further decided that the affective impact of Project Concern would be evaluated through a survey of the attitudes of students, suburban teachers, and suburban parents using questionnaires.

  abstract = {Project Concern in Hartford bused approsimately 260 inner city children to suburban elementary schools. The project was designed to evaluate experimentally the effects of (1) placement in a suburban school with or without remedial-supportive assistance and (2) placement in an inner city school with or without compensatory services. Criterion variables used to evaluate the treatment were mental ability, academic achievement, personal-social development, and creativity. Findings of a 1968 evaluation suggested that the bused experimental children in suburban classes in grades K-3 had a significantly greater tendency to show growth in mental ability than the control children remaining in inner city classrooms. In grades 4 and 5, however, the controls showed better achievement than the experimentals. The effects of supportive assistance were mixed. It was felt that the placement of two or three children in a suburban classroom had no measurable negative effect on the academic achievement},

The goals were to change the de facto desegregation of the inner city schools, to design an effective, supportive educational intervention program to arrest and remediate school failure, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the experiment. The project design involved four groups--(1) bused students receiving supportive services in the suburban schools, (2) bused students receiving no support, (3) nonbused students receiving support- in their inner city schools, and (4) nonbused students receiving no support. There were gaps in the data collection process which seriously limited the interpretation of the findings. However, the bused students showed regular attendance, persistence in school placement, and participation in extracurricular activities. The suburban teachers found them responsive to high academic expectations and able to adjust quickly. No},

The students were nearly all non-Hispanic American blacks, and a few were of Puerto Rican or West Indian ancestry. The main finding was that the desegregated black students obtained different types of employment than did the students in the control group. The desegregated students are now working in occupations which are less commonly held by blacks: for instance, men are salesmen rather than postmen, while women are secretaries rather than nurses' aides. In general, those who experienced desegregated schooling are more likely to be working in white collar and professional jobs in the private sector, while those from segregated schools are more likely to be working},

Teacher reports, interviews, etc. were also utilized. The overall pattern of differences between experimental and controls indicates that programs, if begun in suburban schools by grade 3, can influence experimentals toward better understanding of expectations, i.e., better test-taking skill, increased self-discipline, and increased},

However, despite the increasing public awareness of and responsiveness to the problem, racial and economic isolation persists. The following existing integration initiatives are described and examples of improvements are suggested: (1) Interdistrict Cooperative Grants Program (including both planning and implementation grants); (2) Project Concern, an intercommunity program for disadvantaged students; (3) State Summer School Grant Program; (4)

  abstract = {Public charter schools, interdistrict magnet schools, and the Open Choice program are collectively
called Choice programs. One of their key missions is to improve educational outcomes of historically
underperforming students from Connecticut’s urban public schools. This analysis examines the academic
growth and outcome performance based on the Connecticut Mastery Tests (CMT) for Choice program
attendees from Connecticut’s four largest cities—Bridgeport, Hartford, New Haven, and Waterbury—over
a two-year period (2010 to 2012).
To conduct the most effective examination of ex post facto or pre-existing data where random assignment
is either impossible or unethical (Murnane, R.J. and Willett, J.B., 2011), 30 stratified random samples of
quasi-controls were generated from the co-present population of CMT test-takers. Then, the academic
results for urban Choice program attendees were compared with results from the 30 samples. To counter
known biasing influences such as higher baseline test performance, these quasi-control samples were
matched with their respective Choice program “treatment group” on baseline test performance as well as
on student background characteristics known to be related to test performance (Behuniak, P., Mooney, R.
F., Cloud, R., 1990).
Results for each Choice program group and its respective quasi-control groups were tracked and compared
longitudinally for the same students in two grade cohorts:
1. Grade 3 in 2010 to Grade 5 in 2012
2. Grade 6 in 2010 to Grade 8 in 2012
The use of longitudinal data allows us to ascribe academic performance gains over time to the educational
interventions that have taken place; additionally, comparing gains achieved by the Choice program groups
to their respective quasi-control groups enables us to control for gains that might have occurred naturally
due to student maturation.
In the Grades 3 to 5 cohort, the analysis reveals statistically meaningful gains at or above the CMT
Proficient level in interdistrict magnet schools operated by regional educational service centers (RESCs)
and for the Open Choice program, and nearly statistically meaningful gains at or above the CMT Goal
level for the RESC-operated interdistrict magnet schools.
In the Grades 6 to 8 cohort, public charter schools alone showed statistically meaningful gains at or above
Proficient and Goal levels on the CMT.
This study remains an ex post facto, or “after the fact” analysis, thus not allowing causal attribution of the
program outcomes. Hence, in practice it cannot be said with certainty that clones of these Choice programs,
or an exportation of specific pedagogical techniques and strategies used, will necessarily ensure
similar performance successes for urban students in general.},

  abstract = {As the incomes of affluent and poor families have diverged over the past three decades, so too has the educational performance of their children. But how exactly do the forces of rising inequality affect the educational attainment and life chances of low-income children? In Whither Opportunity? a distinguished team of economists, sociologists, and experts in social and education policy examines the corrosive effects of unequal family resources, disadvantaged neighborhoods, insecure labor markets, and worsening school conditions on K-12 education. This groundbreaking book illuminates the ways rising inequality is undermining one of the most important goals of public education—the ability of schools to provide children with an equal chance at academic and economic success. The most ambitious study of educational inequality to date, Whither Opportunity? analyzes how social and economic conditions surrounding schools affect school performance and children’s educational achievement. The book shows that from earliest childhood, parental investments in children’s learning affect reading, math, and other attainments later in life. Contributor Meredith Phillip finds that between birth and age six, wealthier children will have spent as many as 1,300 more hours than poor children on child enrichment activities such as music lessons, travel, and summer camp. Greg Duncan, George Farkas, and Katherine Magnuson demonstrate that a child from a poor family is two to four times as likely as a child from an affluent family to have classmates with low skills and behavior problems – attributes which have a negative effect on the learning of their fellow students. As a result of such disparities, contributor Sean Reardon finds that the gap between rich and poor children’s math and reading achievement scores is now much larger than it was fifty years ago. And such income-based gaps persist across the school years, as Martha Bailey and Sue Dynarski document in their chapter on the growing income-based gap in college completion.Whither Opportunity? also reveals the profound impact of environmental factors on children’s educational progress and schools’ functioning. Elizabeth Ananat, Anna Gassman-Pines, and Christina Gibson-Davis show that local job losses such as those caused by plant closings can lower the test scores of students with low socioeconomic status, even students whose parents have not lost their jobs. They find that community-wide stress is most likely the culprit. Analyzing the math achievement of elementary school children, Stephen Raudenbush, Marshall Jean, and Emily Art find that students learn less if they attend schools with high student turnover during the school year – a common occurrence in poor schools. And David Kirk and Robert Sampson show that teacher commitment, parental involvement, and student achievement in schools in high-crime neighborhoods all tend to be low.For generations of Americans, public education provided the springboard to upward mobility. This pioneering volume casts a stark light on the ways rising inequality may now be compromising schools’ functioning, and with it the promise of equal opportunity in America.},

  isbn = {978-1-61044-751-5},
  abstract = {In this chapter I examine whether and how the relationship between family socioeconomic characteristics and academic achievement has changed during the last fifty years. In particular, I investigate the extent to which the rising income inequality of the last four decades has been paralleled by a similar increase in the income achievement gradient. As the income gap between high- and low-income families has widened, has the achievement gap between children in high- and low-income families also widened?

The answer, in brief, is yes. The achievement gap between children from high- and low-income families is roughly 30 to 40 percent larger among children born in 2001 than among those born twenty-five years earlier. In fact, it appears that the income achievement gap has been growing for at least fifty years, though the data are less certain for cohorts of children born before 1970. In this chapter, I describe and discuss these trends in some detail. In addition to the key finding that the income achievement gap appears to have widened substantially, there are a number of other important findings.

First, the income achievement gap (defined here as the average achievement difference between a child from a family at the 90th percentile of the family income distribution and a child from a family at the 10th percentile) is now nearly twice as large as the black-white achievement gap. Fifty years ago, in contrast, the black-white gap was one and a half to two times as large as the income gap. Second, as Greg Duncan and Katherine Magnuson note in chapter 3 of this volume, the income achievement gap is large when children enter kindergarten and does not appear to grow (or narrow) appreciably as children progress through school. Third, although rising income inequality may play a role in the growing income achievement gap, it does not appear to be the dominant factor. The gap appears to have grown at least partly because of an increase in the association between family income and children’s academic achievement for families above the median income level: a given difference in family incomes now corresponds to a 30 to 60 percent larger difference in achievement than it did for children born in the 1970s. Moreover, evidence from other studies suggests that this may be in part a result of increasing parental investment in children’s cognitive development. Finally, the growing income achievement gap does not appear to be a result of a growing achievement gap between children with highly and less-educated parents. Indeed, the relationship between parental education and children’s achievement has remained relatively stable during the last fifty years, whereas the relationship between income and achievement has grown sharply. Family income is now nearly as strong as parental education in predicting children’s achievement.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the origins of Open Choice, a two-way, voluntary bussing transfer program in Hartford, Connecticut and the surrounding region.  Originally a two-year experiment called Project Concern, the purpose of this bussing program was to desegregate Hartford’s schools and to combat the enormous racial and economic imbalances between Hartford and the surrounding suburban towns.  Project Concern was established in 1966 in the midst of President Johnson’s Great Society legislation and reforms, and was a product of the idealism and experimental environment of the mid-1960s.  This paper focuses on the origins of Project Concern within that environment, the struggles it endured to persist, and the student outcomes following the first two years of the program, from 1966-1968.},

This analysis extends the residential attainment literature by examining the neighborhood racial composition of middle-class blacks and whites while controlling for residential preferences. Methods.  Using the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality and 1990 Census data, the spatial assimilation and place stratification theories of locational attainment are tested. Results.  As in previous research, support is shown for both theories; for blacks, stronger human capital characteristics translate into neighborhoods that are less racially segregated. However, even when middle-class blacks prefer to live in integrated neighborhoods, on average, they live in neighborhoods that are about 60 percent black and 30 percent white, while middle-class whites who prefer to live in integrated neighborhoods reside in neighborhoods that, on average, are 10 percent black and 85 percent white. Conclusions.  Although incorporating residential preferences into models that predict neighborhood racial composition proves important, the relative inability of middle-class blacks to implement their preferences indicates powerful social forces that maintain “American apartheid.”},

This article tests the racial proxy hypothesis using an innovative experiment that isolates the net effects of race and social class, followed by an analysis of the social psychological factors associated with residential preferences. The authors find that net of social class, the race of a neighborhood’s residents significantly influenced how it was rated. Whites said the all‐white neighborhoods were most desirable. The independent effect of racial composition was smaller among blacks, who identified the racially mixed neighborhood as most desirable. Further, whites who held negative stereotypes about African‐Americans and the neighborhoods where they live were significantly influenced by neighborhood racial composition. None of the proposed social psychological factors conditioned African‐Americans' sensitivity to neighborhood racial composition.},

An over-the-telephone factorial experiment addresses these issues, measuring variables that shape white Americans' choice of purchasing a home. Based on a national, random-digit-dial survey of 1,663 white Americans, the effects of African American, Asian, and Hispanic neighborhood composition on whites' likelihood of buying a house are explored, as well as the other variables for which race may serve as a proxy. Results indicate that Asian and Hispanic neighborhood composition do not matter to whites. Black neighborhood composition, however, does matter, and matters even more for white Americans with children under age 18. The effect of black composition is net of the variables that whites offer as the primary reasons they do not want to live with blacks.

Results show that independent of proxies, whites find neighborhoods less attractive as the proportion black or Hispanic increases; the proportion Asian has no impact.

  abstract = {Mapping Segregation in Washington DC is a public history project documenting the historic segregation of DC’s housing, schools, playgrounds, and other public spaces. To date the project has focused on racially restrictive housing covenants. Racial covenants had a dramatic impact on the development of the nation’s capital decades before government-sanctioned redlining policies were implemented in cities across the country.

Explore this story map to learn why many of DC’s “historically black” neighborhoods were once exclusively white, and how the city’s racial geography has been shaped by segregation. As Mapping Segregation’s first installment, the story map focuses on legal challenges to covenants and where they took place. It also reveals why DC was central to the struggle to abolish restricted housing nationwide.

This is the first project of its kind; racial covenants have never been comprehensively documented for any American city nor combined or exhibited with other data in this way. Organized by Prologue DC and GIS mapping specialist Brian Kraft of JMT Technology Group, it was launched in January 2014 and has been funded in part by Humanities DC.},

  abstract = {Our current school funding system often bolsters school district boundaries between rich and poor, holding resources in wealthy communities and keeping low-income students from accessing broader opportunities.

In June, The Supreme Court decided Texas v. Inclusive Communities Project, affirming that no government policy, even one without discriminatory intent, may create “artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers” for minority individuals and families seeking quality housing in a good neighborhood. However, one kind of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barrier continues to separate families—often poor and minority families—from places of opportunity: school-district boundaries.

In the United States, the public school a student attends is still primarily determined by where their family lives. Most children are enrolled in district schools that receive, on average, nearly half of their funding through local property taxes. This system ties school budgets to the value of local property wealth and incentivizes boundaries between upper- and lower-income communities. Intentional or not, these invisible walls often concentrate education dollars within affluent school districts, and ensure that low-income students are kept on the outside.

This map, which shows student poverty levels within the more than 13,000 school districts in the United States, begins to paint a picture of this phenomenon: school districts drawn in odd shapes and sizes, many sitting next to—or even inside of—districts of wildly different means},

In Connecticut, Hartford trailed census returns in Bridgeport and New Haven, which had return rates of 54 percent and 49 percent, respectively. Hartford trailed such notoriously poor American cities with historically low census returns as East St. Louis, Ill.; Atlantic City, N.J.; and New Orleans.
The Census Bureau's top official in New England vowed Wednesday that a strong follow-up response by the government over the next three months would catch the more than 20,000 households in Hartford that did not return their questionnaires. Starting the first week in May, a small army of more than 600 census-takers will be charged with knocking on every door in Hartford and the rest of Connecticut where residents did not return their census form.},

  abstract = {"This is probably one of the best places on this planet to get a high school education," said Stan Piorkowski, who teaches two pre-calculus courses, two geometry courses, honors algebra and remedial math. He also has coached basketball at the school 26 years, first as an assistant to John Cuyler 11 years and as head coach since the 1978-79 season.
Honor student Kendrick Moore, barely 17 and a junior, is point guard or shooting guard, depending on the situation. He's 6-2, taller than Paul Spence, Troy Love or Michael Adams (now an NBA veteran), who were all starters on previous HPHS teams. Moore hit 14 of 15 shots from the field against Wilbur Cross-New Haven. Michael Thompson is the 110 percenter who always guards the other team's best player; Tyrone White the clever ball handler, Courtney Dunstan the junior varsity player who improved enough to win a starting varsity job; TaVarr Closs the 6-5, 260-pound super sixth man who is agile, sure-handed and dependable. The rest of the cast is strong as well.
It feels good to be on top, Piorkowski says, a little uncomfortable, maybe, but good. "It's not something I'm used to," Piorkowski said, "but we're enjoying it. It's exciting here at the school and attendance is up.},

I will begin by focusing on the history and growth of the institution, from its humble beginnings as a rural, agricultural college in the late 1880s to the present day, as a growing national research institution with an ambitious strategic plan. Next, I will turn my attention to UConn’s recent history to consider how a series of policies, practices, and initiatives have diversified the undergraduate student body in the past thirty years. While the University has made considerable strides in admitting, retaining, and educating a student body that more proportionately reflects the demographics of the state population, a series of recent incidents reveals latent attitudes of racism, sexism, and the need for greater attention to fostering an inclusive campus climate. In the final section of the paper, I will conclude by considering the larger opportunities and challenges facing the future of UConn and how these factors reflect larger trends impacting contemporary higher education across the country.},

Suddenly, the black population was falling in Hartford, while it surged in suburbs such as East Hartford, West Hartford, Manchester and Windsor. Bloomfield, which has had a large black population for decades, saw its black population continue to grow.

Almost 90 percent of the people in Greater Hartford live outside the city of Hartford, and enjoy good schools, nice neighborhoods, fine recreational opportunities. If Hartford were defined by its metropolitan area, instead of an 18-square-mile inner ring, we wouldn't be one of the poorest cities in the country, we'd be one of the wealthiest.
Consider Jacksonville, Fla. The metro area has 1.1 million people, about the same as Hartford's. But while 120,000 people live in the 18-square-mile city of Hartford, 800,000 people live in the 841-square-mile city of Jacksonville.},

That might surprise local denizens still smarting from last year's New York Times Page 1 story: "Poverty in Land of Plenty: Can Hartford Ever Recover?" The N.Y. Times piece was a teeth-kicker. It rehashed the well-documented problems in the capital city -- poverty, education, crime, race relations -- and gave scant attention to any progress.
The disparate takes from the two coasts in less than a year frames the problems for folks who make it their business to put a shine on Hartford's reputation. They confront two contrasting perceptions -- the idea that Hartford is so disproportionately saddled with poor people and social ills that it is unsalvageable vs. the view that this multicultural city, with its first Latino mayor and more than a billion dollars in planned development, is poised for a resurgence. I'm in the camp that believes the latter.
"This was a city with a riches-to-rags past," says Times reporter David Lamb, who wrote the article. "But I was impressed that the city and a lot of those neighborhoods are owning up to what's gone wrong and making serious attempts to bring Hartford back. I had a friend in Hartford who said he thought I was pretty kind to Hartford, but I was certainly impressed with a lot of the things I saw going on there."},

For the United States, the percentage of people in poverty and in extreme poverty declined during the booming '90s. But in Connecticut, the rate of people below the poverty line, and the rate of those under half the poverty line, both increased.
The UConn population center is using migration and birth statistics to investigate a host of questions raised by their poverty discovery: Did extreme poverty soar because people moved into the state from elsewhere in the country or through foreign immigration? Did very poor people add to their numbers by having children? Did people fall back into deep poverty because of the economy?},

A photo of the blue-domed Colt armory, a sign of hope to those who see Hartford's history as a big part of its future, appeared on newsstands and in homes far from Connecticut as a symbol of the city's shame. At the risk of sounding defensive, this is not a fair picture of a work in progress. The article's author dwelled exclusively on the empty half of the glass.
Indeed, it has been stated on these pages many times that Hartford -- and by extension, Connecticut -- would benefit from more regional cooperation, including revenue sharing among towns in Greater Hartford. The need for property tax reform has been obvious for at least a decade. The switch to a strong mayor and more cooperation among political factions on the city council are keys to accountability in city government.
Sure, the statistical snapshot of Hartford is quite a contrast to the Gilded Age when Sam Colt, [Mark Twain] and other of Hartford's notable citizens chose to live and work here. The hotbed of industry that produced revolvers, sewing machines, typewriters and bicycles is definitely not the place it used to be.},

  abstract = {Which Hartford and suburban families were more (or less) likely to apply to the Regional School Choice Office for public school choice options such as interdistrict magnet schools, and how do these families vary by student characteristics \& achievement, school composition, and neighborhood/town demographics? Report 2 offers a statistical analysis of 17,710 applicants to the Spring 2013 RSCO lottery, matched to a broader pool of over 170,000 potential applicants from the RSCO transportation region in the Public School Information System (PSIS) database. 

Overall, this report expands on our prior finding that in Report 1 that participation in the RSCO application process was not random, but linked to certain characteristics. Among Hartford-resident K-11 students, English Language Learners were much less likely to apply (26 percent fewer students than expected), those with special education needs were somewhat less likely to apply (16 percent fewer than expected), and those living in higher-income or higher-homeownership areas were more likely to apply (24 and 28 percent more students than expected, respectively). Regarding test score differences, Hartford applicants had slightly higher reading scores than non-applicants, but this disparity was small and was not found in any other subject areas. Along racial lines, we found that Hartford Black students were more likely to apply (11 percent more than expected), while Hispanic students were less likely (8 percent fewer than expected), with no difference for White students.

Among suburban K-11 students, those from lower-income families were more likely to apply (43 percent more than expected). Black suburban students were much more likely to apply (169 percent more than expected), and Hispanic suburban students were more likely to apply (48 percent more than expected), while White suburban students were less likely to apply (47 percent fewer than expected). Students in suburbs with more than 60 percent minority enrollment were far more likely to apply (132 percent more students than expected). Regarding achievement tests, higher-scoring suburban students were less likely to apply (12 percent fewer students than expected).},

The Buildings
The Wadsworth Atheneum is comprised of five connected buildings. The first was the Gothic Revival Wadsworth building of 1844, designed by the eminent architects Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis. It originally housed the art gallery, the Connecticut Historical Society, the Young Men’s Institute (which became the Hartford Public Library), and the Natural History Society. The Watkinson Library of Reference was added to the original building in the 1860s
. . . By 1964, the institutions not affiliated with the art museum had moved to other Hartford locations.

When the Goodwin building, designed in a late modernist style, opened to the public in 1969, the entire facility was devoted to the fine arts for the first time, Daniel Wadsworth’s original intention."},

  abstract = {This study examines the nation’s oldest voluntary public school integration effort, Milwaukee’s Chapter 220 program, and describes its rise and decline. Chapter 220 was designed to integrate Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) and its suburban districts. Employing document analysis using 40 years of primary and secondary documents, including school board minutes and district reports that speak directly to the issue of school integration and the Chapter 220 program, this case study demonstrates how legislative policies that looked race neutral on the surface (Open Enrollment) contributed to the decline of the Chapter 220 Program, which had explicit affirmative action goals. This study fills a crucial void on the demise of school integration programs by focusing on legislative rather than legal decisions contributing to the demise of school integration program and has implications for other voluntary integration programs across America that have not been challenged legally.},

However, limited research exists that explores how suburban district leaders are responding to such changes, and what factors may shape their responses. To better understand how districts within these communities are responding to suburban diversification, we conducted a qualitative case study of a large and rapidly changing suburban district. We interviewed top-level district administrators, principals, and teachers at three case study schools that were undergoing particularly rapid demographic shifts. We found that instead of directly addressing issues of race in the district, the district’s response was colorblind in design: It was racially conscious of changes in student demographics, but its practices to address these changes were race-neutral. Findings suggest that districts must assert a framework for responding to issues of race in the face of demographic change.},

Chana Joffe-Walt reports on the Hartford, CT school system, which actively seeks to integrate. The results have been impressive. It used to be that 11\% of Hartford students were in integrated schools. Now it’s nearly half. But the trick to the whole thing is: convince white families it’s in their self- interest to go to integrated schools. This requires the kind of marketing skills and savvy we’re more used to seeing at Apple and Pepsi than we are at a public school district. (38 minutes)
Act Two: What's it all About, Arne?
Reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones, who has investigated integration in schools for years, joins Chana Joffe-Walt to interview the Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan. The Obama Administration says it’s in favor of integrating the schools, but doesn’t seem to do so much to promote it. They seemed to have the perfect opportunity, integration advocates say, with their Race to the Top program. But even then they didn’t act. Nikole and Chana ask: what’s the deal? (8 minutes)

Prologue: Ira speaks with New York Times Magazine Reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones about her years reporting on education and the various kinds of school reforms administrators have tried to close the achievement gap that never seem to work. Nikole says there's one reform that people have pretty much given up on, despite a lot of evidence that it works – school integration. (11 minutes)

The literature review and data analysis identify the key factors that seem to have contributed to bifurcated patterns in achievement gaps. The conventional measures of socioeconomic and family conditions, youth culture and student behavior, and schooling conditions and practices might account for some of the achievement gap trends for a limited time period or for a particular racial and ethnic group. However, they do not fully capture the variations. This preliminary analysis of covariations in racial and ethnic gap patterns across several large data sets has implications for future research on the achievement of minority groups.},

I find evidence that the process of charter school choice in Indianapolis leads to higher degrees of racial isolation and less diversity within schools than is present in the underlying process of student school transfers in the public school district from which a majority of these students came.},

The case of Flint, Michigan, complicates these views, at once illustrating the depth of governmental commitment to segregation in a northern community and showing how segregated schools and neighborhoods helped construct one another. The Flint case also reveals new modes of segregationist thought. Throughout much of the twentieth century, Flint’s city leaders thought of segregation as splitting, and they sought to divide their city along racial lines. But they thought of segregation as joining as well. Drawing on various strands of progressive reform and educational thought, Flint’s educational, business, and philanthropic leaders believed community bonds would be stronger in segregated neighborhoods anchored by their schools. Flint’s “community schools” program worked toward this end, exemplifying the paired embrace of segregation as joining and splitting, and becoming a model for educators in hundreds of cities nationwide.},

In 1890s, John C Webster, VP of Aetna life insurance, raised legislative bill for Hartford to annex "morningside strip" of WH (?possibly referring to west side of Prospect Ave?)
A second effort annexation of east side of WH came later due to "great dissatisfaction over tax matters"

Recently Secretary WL Mead of Hartford Chamber of Commerce wrote Courant letter in favor of Hartford reuion; he writes about businessmen: "Men engaed in large enterprises in Hartford are indirectly -- through the state of Connecticut -- paying taxes on the stocks of their companies, about \$5,000 annually, which the state returns to West Hartford, when by drawing an imaginary line this would reach Hartford, where it morally belongs."
But this would mean reduction in income for WH
Mead: "The best intersts of Hartford and West Hartford are wrapped up in the greater city and teh bringing together of the two towns under the same municipal government, it would seem, cannot be delayed infinitely."

  abstract = {This research investigates the experience of systemic restricted choice and its impact on self-concept among racial and ethnic minority consumers seeking financing. Choosing loans is an involved consumer choice journey, and encountering systemic, chronic, and uncontrollable restrictions on choice at any level of the goal/choice hierarchy limits and even prohibits minorities' ability to make desired choices. Across a multimethod investigation, these three studies demonstrate that minorities experiencing systemic restricted choice endure deleterious impacts to self-concept, including framing the self as fettered, alone, discriminated, and subservient, as well as marked reductions in self-esteem, self-autonomy, and self-efficacy. Minority consumers also frame themselves as striving in a world of limited resources and fighting uphill, often losing battles. Juxtaposing the experiences of racial/ethnic minorities against the choice journeys of educationally and economically similar white consumers puts those minority experiences in sharp relief. The theoretical and transformative consumer research implications of these findings are discussed.

Marketplace radio 2015-07-02: "For a study published last year in a journal from Oxford University Press, a team of researchers from Rutgers, Brigham Young and Utah State universities sent “mystery shoppers” into about 80 banks. They posed as small business owners looking for a loan. They all had the same story and the same outfit — and were even selected to be equally tall and good looking — but some were black, some were white and some were Latino.

As one of the researchers, Rutgers business professor Jerome Williams, puts it: “We found significant differences.”

The study found bank officers asked tougher questions of minority applicants. For instance, they wanted to see more years of financial records.

The mystery shoppers also used hidden cameras.  According to the study, everybody who saw the tapes agreed: bank officers were just nicer to white applicants.

With white applicants, Williams says, “There was a lot of bantering, interaction, jokes — being very, very friendly.”

With the black and Latino mystery shoppers, not so much.

It led to a simple conclusion. For black and Latino entrepreneurs looking for a bank loan, “The playing field is not level,” Williams says. “There’s already a mark against you in terms of your background in applying for a loan.”},

They find, first, that people will pay more for better, well-funded schools. The economists discover than a regional funding increase of \$1,000 per student is associated with a \$570 annual increase in what people are willing to pay.

Meanwhile, the percentage of residents living in middle-income neighborhoods shrunk 7 percent.

These trends show that income inequality is a chronic issue — and that the polarization of Connecticut neighborhoods is growing. Studies show that this concentration of wealth and poverty causes several negative outcomes. Among them are poor health and high crime in areas of extreme poverty, and the concentration of regional resources in very affluent neighborhoods for richer residents.

Additionally, our recently published analysis that compared Connecticut to a national study of racially concentrated affluence showed that Connecticut faces racial segregation along income lines that in many ways surpass those of other large metropolitan areas.

Later, the legislature passed a special act, 1929 Conn. Spec. Acts p. 859, which consolidated the city and town school districts. The special act required acceptance by the voters. Two questions were placed on the ballot, one to approve the consolidation and one to accept the special act. The voters rejected the consolidation but approved the special act. The court found that the special act became valid and effective by virtue of the votes taken because the purpose of the special act was clearly to accomplish the consolidation of the school districts and the fact that the voters voted against the consolidation was superfluous where they voted to accepted the special act. The court further held that Conn. Gen. Stat. § 257b was applicable notwithstanding that consolidation was effected under the special act because a provision for adjustment of differences in the value of property of the respective districts was an integral feature of the consolidation of school districts and there was no implied repeal of § 257b by the special act.},

The Courant conducted that analysis for 19 towns in the Hartford region, and the results offer some evidence of a widening gap between the highest- and lowest-performing districts in the state.

For the analysis, the Courant examined the percentage of students scoring at high achievement levels on the SBAC test (those who met or exceeded the target achievement level) and calculated how each district performed compared to the state average. We did the same thing for the CMT and CAPT tests in 2013 – the last year the tests were widely administered (looking at students deemed “at goal”). Then we looked at whether districts had improved their position relative to the state average, or whether they lost ground compared to the state as a whole.},

But Hartford kept it going, and in 1992 moved it to the old Mountain Laurel School in the Blue Hills neighborhood.

  volume = {117},
  url = {http://www.tcrecord.org/Content.asp?contentid=17961},
  shorttitle = {An {{Accident}} of {{Geography}}?},
  abstract = {Context: Despite the recent emphasis on public school choice, more than four-fifths of public school students still attend the traditional school to which they are assigned (NCES CCD, 2013), making attendance zone boundaries critical and fiercely contested determinants of educational opportunity. Historical and anecdotal evidence suggests that attendance zone boundaries are not “accidents of geography,” but have been “gerrymandered” into irregular shapes in ways that alter patterns of student attendance. However, no empirical evidence has directly examined the issue of attendance zone gerrymandering.
Purpose of Study: Drawing on the literature on electoral gerrymandering, we outline a framework for conceptualizing and measuring educational gerrymandering. Using geospatial techniques, we then provide initial empirical evidence on the gerrymandering of school attendance zones and the variation in gerrymandering across geographic and demographic contexts.

Research Design: We analyze the boundaries of a large national sample of 23,945 school attendance zones obtained from the School Attendance Boundary Information System (SABINS). For each attendance zone, we compute complementary measures assessing two dimensions of gerrymandering: (1) dispersion, or the elongation of the area of a boundary; and (2) indentation, or the irregularity of the perimeter of a boundary.

Results: Overall, we find that attendance zones are highly gerrymandered—nearly as much as legislative districts—and are becoming more gerrymandered over time. Findings underscore the racial and, to a lesser extent, socioeconomic character of gerrymandering, which is particularly acute in Whiter and more affluent schools and in areas experiencing rapid racial change.

Conclusions: The gerrymandering of school attendance zones has significant implications for students and schools. Gerrymandering alters patterns of attendance and, thereby, student access to educational opportunity and resources, by “zoning out” certain students living closer to schools while “zoning in” others living farther away. Gerrymandered boundaries also hold the potential to significantly alter the racial and ethnic composition of schools and may serve as a mechanism of segregation. In addition, gerrymandered attendance zones are inherently inefficient and may impose additional transportation costs on students and districts. We conclude with implications for state and federal policy.},

  abstract = {The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment offered randomly selected families living in high- poverty housing projects housing vouchers to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods. We present new evidence on the impacts of MTO on children's long-term outcomes using administrative data from tax returns. We find that moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood significantly improves college attendance rates and earnings for children who were young (below age 13) when their families moved. These children also live in better neighborhoods themselves as adults and are less likely to become single parents. The treatment effects are substantial: children whose families take up an experimental voucher to move to a lower-poverty area when they are less than 13 years old have an annual income that is \$3,477 (31\%) higher on average relative to a mean of \$11,270 in the control group in their mid-twenties. In contrast, the same moves have, if anything, negative long-term impacts on children who are more than 13 years old when their families move, perhaps because of the disruption effects of moving to a very different environment. The gains from moving fall with the age when children move, consistent with recent evidence that the duration of exposure to a better environment during childhood is a key determinant of an individual's long-term outcomes. The findings imply that offering vouchers to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods to families with young children who are living in high- poverty housing projects may reduce the intergenerational persistence of poverty and ultimately generate positive returns for taxpayers.},

  abstract = {This paper is part of a policy history that seeks to briefly tell the story of the Lanham Act and its local implementation in one of the nation’s most congested war production centers. I make two primary arguments. First, following historian Kristin Szylvian, I argue that the Lanham Act should be divided into three distinct periods: a period between 1940 and mid-1942 when federal funds went toward the construction of what I call ‘educative neighborhoods’; a period between mid-1942 and 1945 when Lanham funds went toward the construction of temporary sites; and a post-war period between 1945 and 1954 when war housing and school facilities were either shuttered, sold, or transferred to local public authorities. Second, in the case of Seattle, I argue that the industrial recruitment of Southern black labor to work at Boeing and Seattle shipyards beginning in the summer of 1942 corresponded with the shift from permanent to temporary housing construction. This shift would set the stage for post-war civil rights activism as temporary housing closed and a racially restricted housing market re-concentrated African American war workers, veterans, and their families.},

The briefing also compares the funding systems for these states to Connecticut’s school funding system.

All of the states examined adjust state education aid to districts to provide additional resources for low-income students and students with disabilities, and nearly all do so for ELLs. However, the details of these adjustments vary significantly.},

  shorttitle = {Inequality in the {{Promised Land}}},
  abstract = {Nestled in neighborhoods of varying degrees of affluence, suburban public schools are typically better resourced than their inner-city peers and known for their extracurricular offerings and college preparatory programs. Despite the glowing opportunities that many families associate with suburban schooling, accessing a district's resources is not always straightforward, particularly for black and poorer families. Moving beyond class- and race-based explanations, Inequality in the Promised Land focuses on the everyday interactions between parents, students, teachers, and school administrators in order to understand why resources seldom trickle down to a district's racial and economic minorities.Rolling Acres Public Schools (RAPS) is one of the many well-appointed suburban school districts across the United States that has become increasingly racially and economically diverse over the last forty years. Expanding on Charles Tilly's model of relational analysis and drawing on 100 in-depth interviews as well participant observation and archival research, R. L'Heureux Lewis-McCoy examines the pathways of resources in RAPS. He discovers that—due to structural factors, social and class positions, and past experiences—resources are not valued equally among families and, even when deemed valuable, financial factors and issues of opportunity hoarding often prevent certain RAPS families from accessing that resource. In addition to its fresh and incisive insights into educational inequality, this groundbreaking book also presents valuable policy-orientated solutions for administrators, teachers, activists, and politicians.},

  abstract = {How we provide equal educational opportunity to an increasingly diverse, highly urbanized student population is one of the central concerns facing our nation.~As Genevieve Siegel-Hawley argues in this thought-provoking book, within our metropolitan areas we are currently allowing a labyrinthine system of school-district boundaries to divide students--and opportunities--along racial and economic lines.~Rather than confronting these realities, though, most contemporary educational policies focus on improving schools by raising academic standards, holding teachers and students accountable through test performance, and promoting private-sector competition. Siegel-Hawley takes us into the heart of the metropolitan South to explore what happens when communities instead focus squarely on overcoming the educational divide between city and suburb.Based on evidence from metropolitan school desegregation efforts in Richmond, Virginia; Louisville, Kentucky; Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina; and Chattanooga, Tennessee, between 1990 and 2010, Siegel-Hawley uses quantitative methods and innovative mapping tools both to underscore the damages wrought by school-district boundary lines and to raise awareness about communities that have sought to counteract them. She shows that city-suburban school desegregation policy is related to clear, measurable progress on both school and housing desegregation.~Revisiting educational policies that in many cases were abruptly halted--or never begun--this book will spur an open conversation about the creation of the healthy, integrated schools and communities critical to our multiracial future.

How we provide equal educational opportunity to an increasingly diverse, highly urbanized student population is one of the central concerns facing our nation. As Genevieve Siegel-Hawley argues in this thought-provoking book, within our metropolitan areas we are currently allowing a labyrinthine system of school-district boundaries to divide students--and opportunities--along racial and economic lines. Rather than confronting these realities, though, most contemporary educational policies focus on improving schools by raising academic standards, holding teachers and students accountable through test performance, and promoting private-sector competition. Siegel-Hawley takes us into the heart of the metropolitan South to explore what happens when communities instead focus squarely on overcoming the educational divide between city and suburb.

Using qualitative interviews with seventy-seven poor and working-class Black parents in Chicago, this article asks: How well do the themes of empowerment, agency, and control characterize the experiences of low-income African American parents tasked with putting their children in schools? Also, what kind of political positions emerge from parents’ everyday experiences given the ubiquitous language of school choice? I find that in their own recounting parents focused on finding a quality school while experiencing numerous barriers to accessing such schools; parents expressed experiential knowledge of being chosen, rather than choosing; and parents highlighted the opacity, uncertainty, and burden of choice, even when they participated in it quite heartily. I argue that their stories convey limited and weak empowerment, limited individual agency, and no control. Their perspectives conjure policy frameworks and political ideologies that require a discussion of entitlements and provision, rather than choice.},

In order to attract and retain professional families to a regenerated central city, downtown schools are re‐branded and promoted to such families as suitable for their children. The article draws on interviews and observation in a particular downtown elementary school to examine the experiences of different groups of parents in this new educational market. The data reveal how middle‐ and upper‐class parents are treated as sought‐after customers who gain and retain positions of influence over the direction of the school once their children are admitted. However, the same processes marginalize low‐income and minority parents. The article concludes that while the goals of the policy may be ostensibly worthy, one of its consequences is to reinscribe existing status positions and inequalities.},

  shorttitle = {Transit {{Era Hartford}}},
  abstract = {The past several decades have been accompanied by a growing concern regarding the viability of auto-centric planning as it relates to environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Research has shown that dense, multimodal urban development has many benefits over the sprawling land use patterns that are so common today. As there are few modern places that are free of automobile-oriented development, historic cities often act as great sources of this information. Unfortunately, it is difficult to fully explore and understand Pre-Automobile Era cities because of a lack of accessible data.
Through GIS digitization of maps of Hartford, Connecticut around 1920, it was possible to quantify characteristics of an historic American city built for pedestrians and compare it to modern-day development patterns. Initial results show that the trolley system of 1920, while not significantly superior to the modern bus system, was effective in moving residents from their homes to the downtown commercial center and moving people throughout the Greater Hartford region. The 1920 system was also accompanied by more multimodal streets and residential land use development that employed a small-scale, uniform building pattern.
This research is a starting point for developing a more advanced analysis of the significant changes to Hartford’s urban fabric as it has gone from transit-oriented to auto-oriented. It is believed that by using tangible data to describe the urban form of the American city before it was dominated by the automobile, important insights can be gained in the push for safer, more sustainable, and more vibrant places.},

  abstract = {As many commentators have pointed out, the land use patterns prevalent in the United States since the advent of Euclidean-style zoning have played a direct role in the development of a surprisingly broad range of problems: “[b]y fostering or requiring low density development with a high separation of uses, Euclidean zoning is one of the great generators of suburban sprawl, with all of its environmental, economic, and social costs.” These costs include pollution, loss of wilderness and farmland, racial and socioeconomic segregation of the population, and legal obstacles to effective urban rehabilitation.6 Moreover, in combination with prevailing patterns of local funding, the socioeconomic segregation caused by Euclidean zoning perpetuates itself by channeling less well-off children into chronically underequipped public schools and stretching the resources of many urban municipalities too thin, leaving them to choose between raising property tax rates or allowing their infrastructure to decay. That devil’s bargain bolsters the tendency of middle- and higher-income people to live in suburbs rather than cities, deepening the downward spiral in which many American cities find themselves. And the damage goes even further: “many current zoning practices disregard or even work against crime prevention goals” in both cities and suburbs. This is particularly problematic in light of the fact that “Euclidean systems of separation—conventional zoning—have been implemented ubiquitously” in the United States: “[a]bout ninety-seven percent of incorporated communities zone.”},

  title = {“{{I Began To Realize That I Had Some Friends}}:” {{Hardship}}, {{Resistance}}, {{Cooperation}}, and {{Unity}} in {{Hartford}}’s {{African American Community}}, 1833-1841},
  abstract = {This thesis is structured to investigate notions of community, and the trials and issues that surround it, through four case studies in the Hartford area between 1833 and 1841. The first chapter of this thesis centers on the case of Prudence Crandall and her attempt to open a school for African American girls in 1833 in Canterbury, Connecticut, a small village outside of Hartford. It shows how Crandall, a white Quaker, was drawn to black activism not simply through the immediatist rhetoric of Garrison (as historians have previously established), but through the free black individuals she came in contact with. These women and men taught her, and other white activists, about the plight of free blacks in Connecticut and about the needs of the black community. The chapter will also show the tremendous prejudice and exclusion faced by free black communities in Connecticut. Due to the complicated legacy of gradual abolition in Connecticut, the fear of amalgamation among whites, and other factors, blacks were effectively cut off from broader society. This exclusion was enforced by legal codes, intimidation, and violence. It is under these conditions that it was necessary for the black community of Hartford, and black communities throughout the North, to cooperate and subsist by any means necessary.
	Chapter Two looks at the role of the Hartford black community, and other similar black communities, in resistance style activism, specifically immediatist abolitionism and Underground Railroad resistance. It argues that the origin of immediatism is found not in evangelicalism or white abolitionist rhetoric, but rather in black communities, enslaved and free. Slave rebellions, free black militancy, and responses to conditions faced by free blacks in the North as well as to the colonization debate all inspired immediatist abolitionism. One of the most important acts of resistance—simultaneously representing a catalyst of and a response to immediatism—was slave flight. The escape of slaves created tension between the North and the South, illuminated many Northerners as to the plight of the enslaved, gave the abolition movement some of its finest figures, and led to the Fugitive Slave Law—a piece of legislation that in many ways set the nation on course for the Civil War. This chapter will look at the Underground Railroad as a network of dedicated activism located in individual and free black community resistance. It examines the typical profile of fugitives and the ways in which new research has broadened the scope of this profile. 
	Chapter Two also highlights the epic story of John Lindsay Smith’s escape from enslavement in Virginia. Smith’s journey took him by land and by sea, travelling at times with companions and at other times alone. He benefitted from the assistance of many Northern blacks, including the prolific Underground Railroad “conductor” David Ruggles and the black community in Hartford. Smith’s narrative gives us insight into the factors that motivated slave flight, the trials that fugitives faced in their passage North, and the ways in which assistance from brave individuals along the way was indispensible on the flight to freedom.
	Chapter Three examines the case of the slave ship Amistad. It demonstrates how white abolitionists, activists within the free black community, and the ship’s captives all contributed to the eventual freedom of the Africans. The chapter elaborates on how these three groups form a community of resistance. The Amistad case is a starting point to discuss the benefits and tensions surrounding interracial activism during this time period. This chapter will look at the trials faced by the Amistad captives as well as at their courage, poise, and wisdom in the face of these struggles. Lewis Tappan as a leading advocate and organizer in the abolitionist support of the Africans is examined in the chapter. It focuses on the tension between Tappan and Reverend James Pennington—over the movement to utilize the Africans as part of a Christian mission to West Africa—to illuminate the distrust and paternalism that often made interracial activism difficult. But it simultaneously highlights the ways in which interracial activism offered unique advantages and was critical to the abolitionist movement.
	Finally, Chapter Four will examine the motivations and philosophies behind localized community improvement activism, through the lens of Reverend Pennington’s early work in Hartford in 1840-1841. It attempts to place Pennington’s work within the black activist tradition of the period, and to open a dialogue about the integrationist versus separationist motivations within self-improvement activism while simultaneously placing Pennington on that spectrum. Pennington’s experiences with enslavement and his writing to reveal the motivations behind his work in community-based activism are central evidence. This chapter will also discuss the ways in which the racism and exclusion outline in Chapter One necessitated strong, insular, self-sustaining black communities in the North—often gathered around churches such as Pennington’s Talcott Street Church. 
	The common thread that unites these four moments is that they all represent community responses to systemic injustice. The courage of a Quaker schoolteacher in the face of racial fears and intimidation, the selfless resistance of Underground Railroad agents against the institution of slavery, the laborious cooperation between white and black activists in a legal battle against the federal government, and the tireless work of a young fugitive slave to uplift the Hartford black community all display the power of marginalized communities to not only sustain themselves in the face of exclusion, but also to affect national change.},

  abstract = {First published in 1999, Mary Pattillo’s Black Picket Fences explores an American demographic group too often ignored by both scholars and the media: the black middle class. Nearly fifteen years later, this book remains a groundbreaking study of a group still underrepresented in the academic and public spheres. The result of living for three years in “Groveland,” a black middle-class neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, Black Picket Fences explored both the advantages the black middle class has and the boundaries they still face. Despite arguments that race no longer matters, Pattillo showed a different reality, one where black and white middle classes remain separate and unequal.~Stark, moving, and still timely, the book is updated for this edition with a new epilogue by the author that details how the neighborhood and its residents fared in the recession of 2008, as well as new interviews with many of the same neighborhood residents featured in the original. Also~ included is a new foreword by acclaimed University of Pennsylvania sociologist Annette Lareau.},

  abstract = {The topic of low-income neighborhoods and the different approaches to community development dominate the national discussion on urban revitalization and poverty reduction. The debate is ongoing, regardless of whether economic development models serve the broader interests of the community or the narrow interests of proponents and benefactors. This study analyzes the impact of urban revitalization projects in the Frog Hollow neighborhood of Hartford, Connecticut, an impoverished but vibrant Latino enclave in the city. Frog Hollow underwent a highly publicized series of revitalization projects during the 2000s, where business owners, community organizations and local government were involved in both development and implementation.
This study focuses on three areas: (a) identifying the history, goals, strategies, and tactics behind the community economic development model used in Frog Hollow; (b) examining the impact of these revitalization projects on the socioeconomic conditions of the neighborhood and its residents; and (c) determining how being a poor, Puerto Rican/Latino enclave impacted the design, process, and implementation of community development projects. By looking at archival and census data, and interviewing key stakeholders, this case study analyzes the impact of urban revitalization on a densely populated ethnic district and its residents, contributing to the body of social work literature on the best practices of community revitalization and development.},

Important as that decision is, however, it ignores the elephant in the room.

The real problem is the 400-year-old system of towns based on the parish boundaries of the Puritans, who required that everyone be able to walk to church. That's why Connecticut towns are approximately the same size geographically — although some of what we quaintly call cities are among the smallest towns (17 square miles in the case of Hartford, 5.5 square miles in New London)."},

  abstract = {In a radically unequal United States, schools are often key sites in which injustice grows. Ansley T. Erickson’s Making the Unequal Metropolis presents a broad, detailed, and damning argument about the inextricable interrelatedness of school policies and the persistence of metropolitan-scale inequality. While many accounts of education in urban and metropolitan contexts describe schools as the victims of forces beyond their control, Erickson shows the many ways that schools have been intertwined with these forces and have in fact—via land-use decisions, curricula, and other tools—helped sustain inequality.  Taking Nashville as her focus, Erickson uncovers the hidden policy choices that have until now been missing from popular and legal narratives of inequality. In her account, inequality emerges not only from individual racism and white communities’ resistance to desegregation, but as the result of long-standing linkages between schooling, property markets, labor markets, and the pursuit of economic growth. By making visible the full scope of the forces invested in and reinforcing inequality, Erickson reveals the complex history of, and broad culpability for, ongoing struggles in our schools.},

There are many new schools and a new enrollment process, making accurate and comprehensive information essential. Is one’s information source related to satisfaction in their choices? Psychological theories suggest that more information may not always be better; people can be overwhelmed and actually make suboptimal choices. I show that a greater reliance on comprehensive sources is related to less confidence that one’s child got into their top choice school, while those parents who use shortcuts, such as social networks and/or school advertising, are more satisfied that they made the right choice. Information sources are not, however, related to the likelihood of enrolling one’s child in a high performing school. Rather, the school performance score is predicted by race and socioeconomic class.},

Each of them had purchased a property that prohibited the occupancy of African Americans and other minority groups through the use of legal instruments called racial restrictive covenants--one of the most pervasive tools of residential segregation in the aftermath of World War II. Over the next three years, local activists and lawyers at the NAACP fought through the nation's courts to end the enforcement of these discriminatory contracts. Unjust Deeds explores the origins and complex legacies of their dramatic campaign, culminating in a landmark Supreme Court victory in Shelley v. Kraemer (1948). Restoring this story to its proper place in the history of the black freedom struggle, Jeffrey D. Gonda's groundbreaking study provides a critical vantage point to the simultaneously personal, local, and national dimensions of legal activism in the twentieth century and offers a new understanding of the evolving legal fight against Jim Crow in neighborhoods and courtrooms across America. -- Book jacket.},

  shorttitle = {The Color of Law},
  abstract = {In this groundbreaking history of the modern American metropolis, Richard Rothstein, a leading authority on housing policy, explodes the myth that America's cities came to be racially divided through de facto segregation--that is, through individual prejudices, income differences, or the actions of private institutions like banks and real estate agencies. Rather, The Color of Law incontrovertibly makes it clear that it was de jure segregation--the laws and policy decisions passed by local, state, and federal governments--that actually promoted the discriminatory patterns that continue to this day. Through extraordinary revelations and extensive research that Ta-Nehisi Coates has lauded as "brilliant" (The Atlantic), Rothstein comes to chronicle nothing less than an untold story that begins in the 1920s, showing how this process of de jure segregation began with explicit racial zoning, as millions of African Americans moved in a great historical migration from the South to the North. As Jane Jacobs established in her classic The Death and Life of Great American Cities, it was the deeply flawed urban planning of the 1950s that created many of the impoverished neighborhoods we know. Now, Rothstein expands our understanding of this history, showing how government policies led to the creation of officially segregated public housing and the demolition of previously integrated neighborhoods. While urban areas rapidly deteriorated, the great American suburbanization of the post-World War II years was spurred on by federal subsidies for builders on the condition that no homes be sold to African Americans. Finally, Rothstein shows how police and prosecutors brutally upheld these standards by supporting violent resistance to black families in white neighborhoods. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 prohibited future discrimination but did nothing to reverse residential patterns that had become deeply embedded. Yet recent outbursts of violence in cities like Baltimore, Ferguson, and Milwaukee show us precisely how the legacy of these earlier eras contributes to persistent racial unrest. "The American landscape will never look the same to readers of this important book," comments Sherrilyn A. Ifill. Indeed, Rothstein's invaluable examination demonstrates that only by relearning American urban history can we finally pave the way for the nation to remedy its unconstitutional past. -- Inside jacket flaps.},

  abstract = {As part of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's commitment to supporting efforts to revitalize the economy of Springfield, Massachusetts, this paper analyzes the economic development approaches of other mid-sized manufacturing-oriented cities during the past half century. From among a comparison group of 25 municipalities that were similar to Springfield in 1960, the study identifies 10 "resurgent cities" that have made substantial progress in improving living standards for their residents, and that are recognized as vital communities in a broader sense by experts on urban economic development and policy. These case studies suggest that industry mix, demographic composition, and geographic position are not the key factors distinguishing the resurgent cities from Springfield. Instead, the most important lessons from the resurgent cities concern leadership and collaboration. Initial leadership in these cities came from a variety of key institutions and individuals. In some cases, the turnaround started with efforts on the part of the public sector, while in other cases nongovernmental institutions or private developers were at the forefront. Regardless of who initiated the turnaround, economic redevelopment efforts spanned decades and involved collaborations among numerous organizations and sectors.

"In the spring of 1966, boards of education in six suburban communities near Hartford, Conn. were asked to accept 300 youngsters from Hartford's Negro section for a two-year experiment in education."--Excerpt from 1966 Peabody Digest. This program is a panel discussion between three men who were involved in conducting a summer school busing program which was similar in structure to the program which would be used for the two-year experiment. All three panelists express pleasure with the results of the summer program and optimism for the fall. Their discussion is punctuated with interviews with black and white families whose daughters participated in the summer program; footage of a workshop session to prepare parents for the fall busing plan; and comments from two teachers who participated in the summer session and one teacher who would participate in the two-year project.

"This program examines what has happened in school desegregation in Connecticut since the U.S. Supreme Court's historic Brown decision. The program focuses on the development of legal efforts to reduce racial isolation in Connecticut's public schools and it reveals the change in perspective that has occurred [sic] among some desegregation proponents who now advocate a 'go-slow' approach if mass busing is involved in reducing racial isolation in public schools."--1979 Peabody Awards entry form. This program examines what changes have occurred since Connecticut's schools first began to be integrated in the late 1960's and the effects integration has had on the quality of education received by Connecticut's students. The case of Brown vs. the Board of Education is discussed along with the problems school boards are facing in interpreting the Court's ruling in the case. Several local school systems are looked at to see how integration has affected them and whether integration has succeeded or not. Busing for desegregation and alternatives to busing are also discussed, including a discussion on merging urban and suburban school systems to achieve a more equally balanced racial mix. Includes excerpts from a speech by William Horowitz, former chairman of the Connecticut Board of Education.

  abstract = {The Sheff v. O’Neill school desegregation case, originally filed in 1989, created an integration movement in the Hartford region that has lasted nearly 30 years.  Despite successes and national recognition, there appears to be a loss of political will and questioning of the merits of integration for the region’s students that has caused efforts to stall.  The Sheff movement has not been forgotten, but to a certain extent misunderstood and bypassed.  Similar to Brown v. Board of Education, the legacy of Sheff is troubled—causing numerous stakeholders to question whether benefits have outweighed the costs, particularly for students of color.  The Sheff case and its outcomes are explored to the present day, discussing future implications for students of color, a strategy of regionalism, and considerations of where the movement and public education in the region goes from here.},

  title = {Desegregating {{Hartford}}: {{Can}} the {{Sheff}} v {{O}}'{{Neill Efforts Survive}} the {{Challenges Ahead}}?},
  abstract = {This paper examines the implementation of school desegregation reform and policy efforts in the greater Hartford region of Connecticut, with a focus on the years 2008-2015. ~These efforts have been the result of the 1996 Connecticut Supreme Court decision in Sheff v. O’Neill, which mandated Connecticut to desegregate the racially isolated schools in Hartford, its capital.  Today, the two main components of compliance with Sheff v. O’Neill are: (1) an interdistrict magnet school system, and (2) a voluntary two-way busing program called Open Choice. ~These programs, operated by the Capital Region Education Council (CREC), have achieved substantial progress toward their goal of school integration in the Hartford region, but many Hartford students remain underserved in racially isolated schools.  This paper explores and analyzes these Sheff-related efforts using an educational change framework; they are now in the continuation phase, but their future remains unclear.  The Hartford school system and interdistrict reforms face numerous challenges ahead, but their successes and failures should be learned from.  Despite desegregation being court mandated, Hartford is a model for integration reforms and interdistrict cooperation, and this paper seeks to shed light on the successful aspects of these efforts and challenges for the future.},

It found a pattern of troubling denials for people of color across the country, including in major metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Detroit, Philadelphia, St. Louis and San Antonio.

In doing so, I make three points. First, documenting previously unacknowledged links between the spread of public education and efforts to market land, I suggest that education, real estate markets, and the state have deeper and more tangled roots than scholars have imagined. Second, I contend that wrestling with these tangled roots suggests the need for scholars to reexamine the role of private markets in shaping the organisation of educational opportunity across places and time. Third, I argue that histories like Oregon’s demonstrate that ‘state’ and ‘market’ are neither stable nor mutually exclusive categories.},

  volume = {120},
  url = {http://www.tcrecord.org/Content.asp?ContentId=22078},
  abstract = {Background/Context: In the first half of the 20th century, American policy makers at all levels of government, alongside housing and real estate industry figures, crafted mechanisms of racial exclusion that helped to segregate metropolitan residential landscapes. Although educators and historians have recognized the long-term consequences of these policies for the making of educational segregation, they have not yet fully perceived how strongly ideas about public schools mattered in the shaping of these exclusionary practices. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This historical study examines the "neighborhood unit" concept, its origins, and its influence, to illustrate the centrality of schooling in shaping mechanisms of racial segregation. The "neighborhood unit" concept, advocated during the 1920s by planner Clarence Perry before becoming central to local-level planning as well as federal-level housing policy, imagined self-contained communities within cities. Each of the units featured multi-purpose school-community facilities at their literal spatial as well as conceptual center. Perry and the influential cadre of planners who adopted the concept thought it would make metropolitan areas more livable, vibrant, and socially cohesive. But their neighborhood unit idea also encouraged racial segregation, in both schools and residential areas. Research Design: Sources for this qualitative historical investigation include published and unpublished primary sources from individuals, organizations, and government entities involved in making and using the idea of the neighborhood unit as well as extant historical scholarship. Conclusions/Recommendations: The history of the neighborhood unit shows that ideas about schools were central in the creation of the modern metropolitan landscape and enduring patterns of racial segregation. This evidence furthers the growing historical interpretation that housing segregation and school segregation operate not as separate terrain, but in deep connection with one another. By acknowledging and incorporating this historical perspective, educators and policy makers can reconceptualize segregation's roots, and perhaps its remedies.},

  abstract = {Bob Fusari, Alan Hanbury Sr., and George Spoll have nearly 120 years of home building experience among them.
"In the 1960s and 1970s, several developments helped push housing prices much, much higher.

One, Spoll said, was housing discrimination, either enforced informally or through the enactment of ordinances.

In West Hartford, where Spoll began building houses in the mid-1950s, "neighborhoods were tacitly redistricted. There was a limit placed on who can buy in certain distinct neighborhoods," Spoll said.

Spoll, who is Jewish, said such discrimination not only applied to Jewish families, but was "a Catholic and Protestant thing as well."

And segregation applied to a growing minority population.

Around the state, many towns adopted large-lot zoning ordinances as a way to discriminate against ethnic groups, Fusari and Hanbury said. But the practice also served to drive up prices.

Fusari said zoning requirements of an acre or more were inefficient because the towns were forced to pay for roads and sewers that served few people. But such zoning also pushed up the cost of housing for everyone by creating a scarcity of land."},

This article explores its utility for historians by examining efforts to exclude different groups of people in a major American metropolis during the 1960s and seventies. This was a period of significant social change, as the racial composition of big city schools shifted dramatically and suburban school districts grew substantially. An examination two such suburban districts finds sustained and effective measures undertaken to exclude African-Americans from moving into one of them. In the neighbouring district, resistance to low-income housing was initially successful but white residents were unable to prevent relatively affluent blacks from settling there. This eventually contributed to further white flight and the transition to a predominantly African-American district. Mechanisms of exclusion are discussed, along with the utility of opportunity hoarding as a concept for historians interested in studying similar issues in other settings.},

Critics assert that these practices perpetuate and exacerbate inequities between schools and communities. In this article we present findings from a critical policy analysis of an advocacy group’s efforts to change Ontario’s fees and fundraising policies over the past two decades. Rhetorical analyses of 110 texts finds that the group constructed the problem of each policy similarly, targeted the same audiences, and utilized many of the same strategies to appeal to logos, ethos, and pathos in their struggle over the policies’ meanings. However, only one out of four of the group’s policy meanings became dominant. The discursive and critical policy perspectives grounding the study directed us to examine how neoliberalism and the policies’ shared broader social, political, and economic contexts can help explain this outcome. Specifically, the group’s efforts to change Ontario’s school fees and fundraising policies confronted dominant discourses that construct parents as consumers of education and responsible for their children’s success in a competitive world, promote the meritocratic notion that successful people deserve their success and the benefits it brings, view the government as responsible only for providing the basic requirements of education, and support privatization and marketization of public schools.},

it remains common practice in Ontario, Canada; findings from a
critical policy analysis of an advocacy group’s efforts to change
fundraising policy help explain why this is the case. Adopting a
discursive understanding of policy, the study used rhetorical analysis
to identify how the group has engaged in a decades-long
struggle over the meaning of fundraising policy. The findings of
the rhetorical analysis were examined in light of an historical
narrative of Ontario’s social context to understand how the policy’s
contexts have constrained the group’s influence. The study’s
findings demonstrate that challenging school fundraising by defining
the policy as a problem of equity is not strong enough to
overcome neoliberalism’s pressure on parents to provide their
children with educational advantages, a trend toward privatization
in public education, neoconservative interests in reduced government
spending, Canadians’ belief in meritocracy, and historical
fundraising practices and dominant meanings. Further, the continuance
of school fundraising even after Ontario’s government
introduced policy that explicitly addressed the group’s concerns
about equity and aimed to limit the practice challenges traditional
notional of group influence and success in policy processes.},

Conceptual and empirical chapters revisit the classic cases of large-scale suburban building in Canada, the former Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, and the United States and examine the new peripheral estates in China, Egypt, Israel, Morocco, the Philippines, South Africa, and Turkey. The contributors examine a broad variety of cases that speak to the building or redevelopment of large-scale peripheral housing estates, tower neighbourhoods, Grands Ensembles, Gro\&\#x3b2;wohnsiedlungen, and Toplu Konut. Concerned with state and corporate policy for building suburban estates, Massive Suburbanization confronts the politics surrounding local inhabitants and their "right to the suburb."},

At the core of this study are the students. This book is the first to draw deeply on rich archival sources, including 1000 pupil records of young people with learning difficulties, who attended public schools between 1918 and 1945. Ellis uses these records to retell individual stories that illuminate how disability filtered down through the school system\&\#39;s many nooks and crannies to mark disabled students as different from (and often inferior to) other school children. A Class by Themselves? sheds new light on these and other issues by bringing special education\&\#39;s curious past to bear on its constantly contested present.},

Making a Global City critically examines the themes of diversity and community in a single primary school, the Clinton Street Public School in Toronto, between 1920 and 1990. From the swift and seismic shift from a Jewish to southern European demographic in the 1950s to the gradual globalized community starting in the 1970s, Vipond eloquently and clearly highlights the challenges posed by multicultural citizenship in a city that was dominated by Anglo-Protestants. Contrary to recent well-documented anti-immigrant rhetoric in the media, Making a Global City celebrates one of the world\&\#39;s most multicultural cities while stressing the fact that public schools are a vital tool in integrating and accepting immigrants and children in liberal democracies.},

It is one region, but separate worlds. And it was designed to be that way. In this deeply reported, revelatory story, duPont Award–winning journalist Lawrence Lanahan chronicles how the region became so highly segregated and why its fault lines persist today. Mark and Nicole personify the enormous disparities in access to safe housing, educational opportunities, and decent jobs. As they eventually pack up their lives and change places, bold advocates and activists—in the courts and in the streets—struggle to figure out what it will take to save our cities and communities: Put money into poor, segregated neighborhoods? Make it possible for families to move into areas with more opportunity? The Lines Between Us is a riveting narrative that compels reflection on America’s entrenched inequality—and on where the rubber meets the road not in the abstract, but in our own backyards. Taking readers from church sermons to community meetings to public hearings to protests to the Supreme Court to the death of Freddie Gray, Lanahan deftly exposes the intricacy of Baltimore’s hypersegregation through the stories of ordinary people living it, shaping it, and fighting it, day in and day out. This eye-opening account of how a city creates its black and white places, its rich and poor spaces, reveals that these problems are not intractable; but they are designed to endure until each of us—despite living in separate worlds—understands we have something at stake.},

  abstract = {It is now impossible to understand major North American cities without considering the seemingly never-ending and ever-growing sprawl of their surrounding suburbs. In The Shape of the Suburbs, activist, urban affairs columnist, and former Toronto mayor John Sewell examines the relationship between the development of suburbs, water and sewage systems, highways, and the decision-making of Toronto-area governments to show how the suburbs spread, and how they have in turn shaped the city. Using his wealth of knowledge of the city of Toronto and new information gathered from municipal archives, Sewell describes the major movements and forces that allowed for rapid development of the suburbs, while considering the options that were available to planners at the time. Discussing proposals to curb suburban sprawl from the 1960s to the recently adopted plan for the Greater Toronto area, Sewell combines insightful and accessible commentary with rigorous research on the debate between urban and suburban. Concerned not only with sprawl, The Shape of the Suburbs also demonstrates the ways in which suburban political, economic, and cultural influences have impacted the older, central city, culminating in the forced Megacity amalgamation of 1998. Rich in detail and full of useful visual illustrations, The Shape of the Suburbs is a lively look at the construction of the suburban era.},

  shorttitle = {Beyond Regime Theory},
  abstract = {In the United States, regime theory has achieved ascendancy in the study of urban politics. This thesis is the first major attempt to test regime theory in suburban Canada. It is also among the first scholarly examinations of mayoral leadership in a Canadian suburban municipality. Based principally, although not exclusively, on qualitative research methods, including detailed primary and historical research, this thesis argues that stable, influential local governance in Canada's largest suburban municipality, the city of Mississauga, Ontario, is the result of pre-emptive, overriding leadership exercised by an individual, and not, as regime theorists would expect, by an informal governing coalition characterized by enduring mutual reciprocity among identifiable groups of public and private actors. Despite the institutionally weak position of Canadian mayors, the case of Mississauga's Hazel McCallion, mayor since 1978, demonstrates that de facto strong mayoral leadership is possible under certain conditions. Although acknowledging the importance of personality, individual skill, and paradigmatic public opinion in the rise and maintenance of such dominant mayoral leadership, this thesis proposes that, in rapidly growing areas on the outskirts of a major central city, sustained pre-emptive, overriding mayoral leadership appears to become possible only following the convergence of two historical-structural variables, what I call a "large suburban canvas" and a "post-reform era." The first term refers to the existence of vast tracts of undeveloped land inside the boundaries of a municipality that is located within a rapidly growing metropolitan area. It presumes there are no serious topological/geographical, infrastructure-related, or rigorous legal impediments to land development. The second term applies to a period following the collapse or exhaustion of the efforts of reformist mayors and/or councils who worked to effect the sweeping dislocation of a previously well entrenched old guard, and who were intent on altering the core priorities and modus operandi of the local government. The hypothesized preconditions are tested using method-of-difference case studies, drawn from different periods in Mississauga's history, which control, to the extent possible, for personality and for each of the posited historical-structural preconditions. The concluding chapter anticipates future developments and leadership dynamics in suburban municipalities that are going through earlier growth phases than Mississauga. It also predicts that, with Mississauga now almost built out, the pre-emptive, overriding leadership cannot last, even if McCallion continues in office.},

  abstract = {The United States is more diverse than ever before. Increased immigration has added to a vibrant cultural fabric, and women and minorities have made significant strides in overcoming overt discrimination. At the same time, economic inequality has increased significantly in recent decades, and the Great Recession substantially weakened the economic standing not only of the poor but also of the middle class. \emph{Diversity and Disparities,} edited by sociologist John Logan, assembles impressive new studies that interpret the social and economic changes in the United States over the last decade. The authors, leading social scientists from many disciplines, analyze changes in the labor market, family structure, immigration, and race. They find that while America has grown more diverse, the opportunities available to disadvantaged groups have become more unequal.  Drawing on detailed data from the decennial census, the American Community Survey, and other sources, the authors chart the growing diversity and the deepening disparities among different groups in the United States Harry J. Holzer and Marek Hlavac document that although the economy always rises and falls over the business cycle, the Great Recession of 2007-2009 was a catastrophic event that saw record levels of unemployment, especially among less-educated workers, young people, and minorities. Emily Rosenbaum shows how the Great Recession amplified disparities in access to home ownership, and demonstrates that young adults, especially African Americans, are falling behind previous cohorts not only in home ownership and wealth but even in starting their own families and households.  Sean F. Reardon and Kendra Bischoff explore the rise of class segregation as higher-income Americans are moving away from others into separate and privileged neighborhoods and communities. Immigration has also seen class polarization, with an increase in both highly skilled workers and undocumented immigrants. As Frank D. Bean and his colleagues show, the lack of a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants inhibits the educational and economic opportunities for their children and grandchildren. Barrett Lee and colleagues demonstrate that the nation and most cities and towns are becoming more diverse by race and ethnicity. However, while black-white segregation is slowly falling, Hispanics and Asians remain as segregated today as they were in 1980.   \emph{Diversity and Disparities} raises concerns about the extent of socioeconomic immobility in the United States today. This volume provides valuable information for policymakers, journalists, and researchers seeking to understand the current state of the nation.},

Setting out to discover what it means - and what it takes - to grow up in this economically disadvantaged and racially and ethnically diverse neighbourhood, Life at the Intersection engages young people, parents and educators to explore the experiences, issues, perceptions and ambitions of the youth of this community. What Carl James finds is that young people have come to appreciate the social capital and cultural wealth of their neighbourhood and that they use the negative perceptions of their community as inspiration for educational and social success. Understanding education as key to encouraging youth to persevere, endure and succeed, this book focuses on youth's educational experiences and expectations and argues that schooling programs must consider socio-geographic context in their efforts to be socially and culturally relevant." --Back cover.},

  shorttitle = {Death of a {{Suburban Dream}}},
  abstract = {Compton, California, is often associated in the public mind with urban America's toughest problems, including economic disinvestment, gang violence, and failing public schools. Before it became synonymous with inner-city decay, however, Compton's affordability, proximity to manufacturing jobs, and location ten miles outside downtown Los Angeles made it attractive to aspiring suburbanites seeking single-family homes and quality schools. As Compton faced challenges in the twentieth century, and as the majority population shifted from white to African American and then to Latino, the battle for control over the school district became symbolic of Compton's economic, social, and political crises.Death of a Suburban Dream explores the history of Compton from its founding in the late nineteenth century to the present, taking on three critical issues—the history of race and educational equity, the relationship between schools and place, and the complicated intersection of schooling and municipal economies—as they shaped a Los Angeles suburb experiencing economic and demographic transformation. Emily E. Straus carefully traces the roots of antagonism between two historically disenfranchised populations, blacks and Latinos, as these groups resisted municipal power sharing within a context of scarcity. Using archival research and oral histories, this complex narrative reveals how increasingly racialized poverty and violence made Compton, like other inner-ring suburbs, resemble a troubled urban center. Ultimately, the book argues that Compton's school crisis is not, at heart, a crisis of education; it is a long-term crisis of development.Avoiding simplistic dichotomies between urban and suburban, Death of a Suburban Dream broadens our understanding of the dynamics connecting residents and institutions of the suburbs, as well as the changing ethnic and political landscape in metropolitan America.},

With research showing that the tax-and-transfer system is less effective than in the past in counteracting growing income disparities, the need for policy-makers to understand the factors at play is all the more urgent. The Institute for Research on Public Policy, in collaboration with the Canadian Labour Market and Skills Researcher Network, has gathered some of the country's leading experts to provide new evidence on the causes and effects of rising income inequality in Canada and to consider the role of policy. Their research and analysis constitutes a comprehensive review of Canadian inequality trends in recent decades, including changing earnings and income dynamics among middle--class and top earners, wage and job polarization across provinces, and persistent poverty among vulnerable groups. The authors also examine the changing role of education and unionization, as well as the complex interplay of redistributive policies and politics, in order to propose new directions for policy. Amid growing anxieties about the economic prospects of the middle class, Income Inequality: The Canadian Story will inform the public discourse on this issue of central concern for all Canadians."--Page 4 de la couverture.},

Although the province acted sporadically and often reluctantly in the face of regional population growth and expansion, Frisken argues that its various interventions nonetheless contributed to the region's most noteworthy achievement: a core city that continued to thrive while many other North American cities were experiencing population, economic, and social decline.  This perceptive and comprehensive examination of issues related to the evolution of city regions is critical reading not only for those teaching and researching in the field, but also for city and regional planners, officials at all levels of government, and urban historians.

  abstract = {By questioning the widely accepted picture of suburban society which has been developed by many sociologists, social psychologists, and other serious students of social science, as well as by popular writers, this book will challenge much of our thinking about certain trends and developments in present-day society. The author, a distinguished Canadian sociologist, shows that there is no essential difference between the new society of the suburbs and any other new society in terms of the kind of forces which produced it. The suburban societies so far studied, he maintains, have been selected because they conform to the existing stereotype, and so the myths have been perpetuated.Professor Clark pays special attention to the mass-developed suburbs. He shows that most suburban dwellers live in areas undergoing mass development, and that in such areas none of the characteristics commonly attributed to suburbia are to be found. The people who have moved to the suburbs in such large numbers are not, the author claims, \&quot;other directed\&quot; as Riesman would maintain, or \&quot;organization men\&quot; as Whyte has called them. They were, rather, mainly interested in finding houses to live in, having been forced out of the city in search of living space. By examining a number of suburban areas around Toronto, Professor Clark shows how the suburban society developed from crude beginnings, lacking almost all the attributes of a society, to a society largely urban in character.},

Merging together several data sets, including Common Core of Data, census data, and shapefiles at multiple geographic scales, we measure segregation of public school students and the entire population over time. We show that school district secession is restructuring school segregation in the counties where secession is occurring, with segregation increasingly occurring because students attend different school districts. Additionally, in the most recent year of analysis, residents were increasingly stratified by race in different school districts. Segregation patterns differ substantially, however, depending on the history of secession in the county.},

From the origins of unequal public school funding after the Civil War through school desegregation cases from Brown v. Board of Education to San Antonio v. Rodriguez in the 1970s, this study spans over a century of racial injustice, dramatic courtroom clashes, and white supremacist backlash to collective justice claims.Incorporating letters from everyday individuals as well as the private notes of Supreme Court justices as they deliberated, Walsh reveals how the idea of a "taxpayer" identity contributed to the contemporary crises of public education, racial disparity, and income inequality.},

  abstract = {The story of the rise of the segregated suburb often begins during the New Deal and the Second World War, when sweeping federal policies hollowed out cities, pushed rapid suburbanization, and created a white homeowner class intent on defending racial barriers. Paige Glotzer offers a new understanding of the deeper roots of suburban segregation. The mid-twentieth-century policies that favored exclusionary housing were not simply the inevitable result of popular and elite prejudice, she reveals, but the culmination of a long-term effort by developers to use racism to structure suburban real estate markets.Glotzer charts how the real estate industry shaped residential segregation, from the emergence of large-scale suburban development in the 1890s to the postwar housing boom. Focusing on the Roland Park Company as it developed Baltimore’s wealthiest, whitest neighborhoods, she follows the money that financed early segregated suburbs, including the role of transnational capital, mostly British, in the U.S. housing market. She also scrutinizes the business practices of real estate developers, from vetting homebuyers to negotiating with municipal governments for services. She examines how they sold the idea of the suburbs to consumers and analyzes their influence in shaping local and federal housing policies. Glotzer then details how Baltimore’s experience informed the creation of a national real estate industry with professional organizations that lobbied for planned segregated suburbs. How the Suburbs Were Segregated sheds new light on the power of real estate developers in shaping the origins and mechanisms of a housing market in which racial exclusion and profit are still inextricably intertwined.},

However, when white households with children do move, they are not more likely than white households without children to move to neighborhoods with fewer blacks or less diversity. Young children may matter for segregation because they influence families to leave more diverse neighborhoods, and white movers generally move into neighborhoods with less diversity, whether or not they have children.},

Surveying the two centuries that preceded Jim Crow’s demise, Race and Education in New Orleans traces the course of the city’s education system from the colonial period to the start of school desegregation in 1960. This timely historical analysis reveals that public schools in New Orleans both suffered from and maintained the racial stratification that characterized urban areas for much of the twentieth century.Walter C. Stern begins his account with the mid-eighteenth-century kidnapping and enslavement of Marie Justine Sirnir, who eventually secured her freedom and played a major role in the development of free black education in the Crescent City. As Sirnir’s story and legacy illustrate, schools such as the one she envisioned were central to the black antebellum understanding of race, citizenship, and urban development. Black communities fought tirelessly to gain better access to education, which gave rise to new strategies by white civilians and officials who worked to maintain and strengthen the racial status quo, even as they conceded to demands from the black community for expanded educational opportunities. The friction between black and white New Orleanians continued throughout the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth, when conflicts over land and resources sharply intensified. Stern argues that the post-Reconstruction reorganization of the city into distinct black and white enclaves marked a new phase in the evolution of racial disparity: segregated schools gave rise to segregated communities, which in turn created structural inequality in housing that impeded desegregation’s capacity to promote racial justice.By taking a long view of the interplay between education, race, and urban change, Stern underscores the fluidity of race as a social construct and the extent to which the Jim Crow system evolved through a dynamic though often improvisational process. A vital and accessible history, Race and Education in New Orleans provides a comprehensive look at the ways the New Orleans school system shaped the city’s racial and urban landscapes.},

  abstract = {Local planning in the United States is unique in the amount of land it reserves for detached single-family homes. This privileging of single-family homes, normally called R1 zoning, exacerbates inequality and undermines efficiency. R1’s origins are unpleasant: Stained by explicitly classist and implicitly racist motivations, R1 today continues to promote exclusion. It makes it harder for people to access high-opportunity places, and in expensive regions it contributes to shortages of housing, thereby benefiting homeowners at the expense of renters and forcing many housing consumers to spend more on housing. Stacked against these drawbacks, moreover, are a series of only weak arguments in R1’s favor about preferences, aesthetics, and a single-family way of life. We demonstrate that these pro-R1 concerns are either specious, or can be addressed in ways less socially harmful than R1. Given the strong arguments against R1 and the weak arguments for it, we contend planners should work to abolish R1 single-family zoning.},

Singling out a few children whose scores fell in the range he categorized as “feeble-minded,” Terman commented:

[They] represent the level of intelligence that is very, very common among Spanish-Indian and Mexican families of the Southwest and also among negroes. Their dullness seems to be racial or at least inherent in the family stocks from which they came. The fact that one meets this type with such extraordinary frequency among Indians, Mexicans, and negroes suggests quite forcibly that the whole question of racial differences in mental traits will have to be taken up anew and by experimental methods.1},
