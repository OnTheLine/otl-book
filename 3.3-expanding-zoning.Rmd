## Expanding and Challenging Zoning {- #expanding-zoning}

After state legislators allowed local governments to enact their own zoning regulations in 1923, Connecticut's growth over the next century has been defined by town leaders who successfully expanded restrictive land-use policies in most suburban and rural areas. But in recent decades, fair-housing advocates have increasingly spoken out against exclusionary zoning and sought to build legislative coalitions to prioritize affordable housing policies in the state's long-term self-interest. This chapter offers a brief overview of this historical conflict over zoning in Connecticut, because we cannot lay out a future without first understanding our past and how we arrived here.

Connecticut's local governments widely embraced exclusionary zoning as a self-interested strategy to deal with population growth and pressure to build more housing during the twentieth century. After the state legislature granted power for all 169 municipalities to make local land-use decisions, protectionist zoning policies quickly spread across Connecticut. Beginning in 1939, the growth of zoning was loosely tracked by the Connecticut Development Commission, a state agency created to promote economic growth and efficient planning for industry and housing. The Commission published a series of maps to illustrate the rise of local planning and zoning agencies in Connecticut, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1946-ctdevcomm-p19) from its 1944-1946 report. Towns that enacted local zoning policies tended to be clustered in the rapidly-growing suburbs around the state's major cities of Hartford, Bridgeport, and New Haven. By 1957, 77 percent (131 out of 169) of town governments had established some type of planning and/or zoning agency, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1957-otl-planning-zoning-ct). Nearly every town within a 20-mile radius of Hartford---including outlying rural areas far from the city center---enacted some type of land-use agency to exert control over what kind of housing could be built in their community.^[@connecticutdevelopmentcommissionReport1946, p. 19; @connecticutdevelopmentcommissionLegislationPassed19571957; @connecticutdevelopmentcommissionDepartmentEconomicCommunity2019.

Why did zoning expand across Connecticut, and how did the level of exclusivity vary across different communities? One factor is competition between suburban town leaders in a race to attract higher-income homebuyers, by using zoning to raise property values and tax revenues, while excluding lower-income residents they believed would require more government spending. Several Connecticut suburbs engaged in a "zoning race" during the mid-twentieth century by sharply increasing the minimum-land requirements to construct a single-family home. At the same time, many suburban towns began to explicitly prohibit the construction of multi-family homes, which generally made more affordable housing options, in order to prevent lower-income residents from moving in.

Consider the example of how zoning evolved in three adjacent but very different suburban towns in the Hartford region: West Hartford, Bloomfield, and Avon. To some degree, their differences in the timing of zoning policy can be explained as a response to population growth. West Hartford became the first to enact zoning during its housing boom and high growth rate of the 1920s, when the population increased 182 percent, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1900-1960-pop-h3sub). In neighboring Bloomfield, town leaders initially hired a zoning expert in the late 1920s, but did not actively expand its zoning policies until its peak growth decade of the 1950s, when its population climbed 137 percent. Meanwhile in Avon, most residents of this farming community initially opposed zoning in the 1930s, but changed course by hiring their own zoning expert in the 1950s, when the population rose 66 percent, and approved even more exclusive minimum-land requirements than their neighboring towns.^[See 1900-1960 population data at https://github.com/ontheline/otl-datawrapper.

When look more closely at *how* towns zoned land during this period, Hartford-area suburbs competed against each other, though not always successfully, with higher minimum-land requirements designed to attract higher-income homebuyers. Back in 1924, West Hartford's most exclusive zone required 9,000 square feet of land for a single-family home. By the mid-1950s, they raised the top zoning level to 18,000 square feet of land for a single residence (today called R-18), as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:1950s-otl-zoning-metro-hartford). By comparison, Bloomfield's most exclusive zone at that time required 40,000 square feet of land for a single residence (R-40). Even more extreme, Avon's most exclusive zone in the mid-1950s required 87,000 square feet (about 2 acres) of land for a single residence (R-87), as shown in Table \@ref(tab:1950s-most-exclusive).^[TODO FIX CITES: Avon Zoning Regulations (amended Oct 19, 1951, and Fall 1953); Bloomfield (adopted March 15, 1950); West Hartford (amended to Dec 3, 1951); adapted from @avonPresentZoningFact1954; see also Bloomfield 1958 and West Hartford 1958 zoning map legends.

To draw meaningful comparisons, we digitized and stitched together mid-1950s paper zoning maps from the three town governments, and converted their minimum-land-per-residence rules into a common scale with modern labels, such as R-87, which means 87,000 square feet of land (about 2 acres) is required to build a single-family home.

| Town  | Zone | Min. land per residence | Scale diagram |
|:------|-----:|------:|--------------------:|
| Avon  | R-87 or East | 87,000 sq ft  | ![](images/1950s-r-87.png) |

*In the table above, during the mid-1950s the minimum amount of land required per single residence in Avon's most exclusive zone (R-87, or 87,000 square feet) was more than two times larger than Bloomfield's most exclusive zone (R-40, or 40,000 square feet), and more than four times larger than West Hartford's most exclusive zone (R-18, or 18,000 square feet).

Furthermore, looking at how much land each suburban town designated as its most exclusionary residential zones in the mid-1950s magnifies the issue, based on our comparisons as shown in Table \@ref(tab:1950s-land-zone). Avon designated 26 percent of its land at the most exclusive R-87 level, and 72 percent of its land at the R-30 level. Meanwhile, Bloomfield designated 32 percent of its land at its highest R-40 level, while West Hartford designated 31 percent of its land at its highest R-18 level.^[TODO: Note that a strict calculation might manually remove park areas from residential zone calculations (such as Pennfield State Park in Bloomfield), but towns did include them in zoning maps, so we left calculations as-is.]

### Challenging Exclusionary Zoning {-}

TO COME...

<!-- Uncovering the roots of our state’s zoning history helps us understand present-day political battles to end exclusionary practices, led by statewide advocacy groups such as the Connecticut Fair Housing Center, the Open Communities Alliance, and Desegregate Connecticut.

But challenging exclusionary zoning across Connecticut is difficult precisely because the state government granted zoning power to its 169 local municipalities, but did not direct any state agency to compile local zoning ordinances in a centralized repository, or measure their collective impact on housing affordability across the state.
