## Expanding Zoning Across Suburbs {- #expanding-zoning}

To be clear, Woods and his contemporaries never used the phrase *exclusionary zoning* when designing their 1920s land-use plan for West Hartford. But town leaders were highly motivated by a fiscal equation that favored exclusion of lower-income families. In this era, local governmental services---such as public schools and street repairs---were funded almost entirely by local property taxes, with limited contributions from state or federal funds. Each town's primary goal was to increase its taxable property, also called the grand list, meaning the total value of all homes and business within its boundaries. Towns sought to increase their total taxable property, while spending a similar proportion on local services, to keep property tax rates relatively low for local property owners. Since all of the towns around Hartford were [carved out as separate local governments](carving.html), they acted in competition against one another, rather than pooling resources together as a regional or county government. When increased transportation and home construction in the 1920s allowed city dwellers to move to nearby suburbs and commute back to their urban workplaces, this sparked town-versus-town competition to attract higher-income residents who could afford to purchase higher-priced homes. As a result, towns adopted zoning laws that set minimum land requirements per family in an attempt to raise the typical home price and build up the tax base, with a minimal expenses for local services and schools. Exclusionary zoning fit perfectly into the logic of the political and economic system.

This section will examine the growth of exclusionary zoning in surrounding Hartford-area suburbs, and the increase of minimum-land requirements to 1-2 acres (43,000 to 87,000 square feet) per single-family home, as towns competed with each other to attract higher-income families during the 1950s and beyond

Note that a strict calculation might manually remove park areas (such as Pennfield state park in Bloomfield) from residential zone calculations, but towns did include them in zoning maps, so left as-is.
