This book represents my running conversation with my students and community residents.....

I teach different types of students at Trinity College.

Some have spent their entire lives on the outside of the lines, typically in wealthy white suburbs....

Others have grown up inside the lines, inside cities like Hartford or large

Still others came of age by crossing the lines, as a Black student in a predominantly White private high school, or as a transfer to a predominantly white suburban public school; or as an international student who is trying to make sense of US schooling.
These students sign up for my classes with some degree of curiosity about the power of the lines in cities and suburbs, or our class awakens them. As one student recently told me, "Before taking this class, I had always thought of schools as the path to equality. But now I realize how school systems can sometimes create inequality." This tension..... Americans expect schools to be a force for democracy...... but at the same time, schools can reproduce inequality (italicize?)

In addition to these questions about schooling, add another layer of complexity about housing. Here's another core contradiction that my students struggle to make sense of: where you live largely determines the quality of education you receive. ......   This is America's not-so-hidden secret. Our public education systems are wrapped up inside our private housing market.



But problem: although my traditional 18-year-old college students have a dozen or more years of experience of school systems, they rarely have any grounded understanding of housing markets. In other words, we turn to education reform as a solution because we have direct experience of a variety of good and not-so-good teachers. But unless you've leased an apartment or bought a house, and directly experienced how wealth and race barriers shape those opportunities, you probably don't have a tangible feel for how housing shapes schooling.

One simple way to address this is through classroom simulations. Explain and link to my simulation....

But a deeper way to teach about the lines is through direct engagement.... what we call community learning...  At Trinity, community learning is the phrase.... not service learning.... explain and link to Dan Lloyd

TRANSITION TO
CONTRADICTION
This book explores America's open secret: how most of our nation's public education system became intertwined with our private real estate market, and created a snarling contradiction of promising hopes and hard realities. On one hand, we preach to our young students, and to our own children, the language of equal educational opportunity and the American Dream. We promise them: if you work hard in school, you too can rise up and achieve your goals. On the other hand, we grant access to most of America's public schools based on students' residence in a school district or attendance area. Only three things matter in real estate, the old joke goes: location, location, and location. The privilege to attend higher-quality public schools is factored into the price of a home, which goes to the highest bidder. We speak as if equal educational opportunity is a constitutional right, while quietly accepting that public school access is bought and sold as a market commodity. It's an open secret because most of us adults know this contradiction, but choose not to explain it to our students and our children. Or maybe we simply can't admit it to ourselves.

The best way to challenge an open secret is to teach others about it.. .. .  .

My goal is not simply to write a book, but to find more effective ways to educate people about the lines that, for better or worse, have shaped our lives.
As I learned more about this subject over the years, and watched how my students and local residents learned during classes and public presentations, I gradually became convinced that expressing my ideas solely through the medium of text was insufficient to fully communicate the power of the lines.
In higher education, particularly in a humanities field such as history, my view is unorthodox, and perhaps heretical to some. My most established colleagues in the field of history write longer and longer books. . . but length does not necessarily lead to learning. Sometimes it can have the opposite effect (as I glance over my bookshelf and see several tomes that I purchased but still have not read.)

Instead, I have learned a great deal about blending analytical prose and data visualizations (such as maps and charts) from digital journalists and others who write on the web.

Over the years I became convinced that expressing ideas through text alone was not



In addition to recognizing privileges and how they shape our lives, I also learned how people from either side of the line can be allies for change. . .[My students and I have interviewed activists for fair housing and equal education opportunities, and followed stories of many others in documents. One of the most common themes is the power of coalitions, or building alliances between city and suburbs to push for change against opposition.] An essential goal of education is to stretch our thinking beyond our own narrow perspective, to see the world through other people's eyes.

Generations of civil rights activists and ordinary families have challenged these boundaries and inspired us to think differently about our future. While they share a common bravery in taking action, they also advanced divergent strategies, operated in various sectors, and defined their goals in different ways over time.

As I learned more about the schooling and housing lines, I began teaching about them through the Cities, Suburbs, and Schools Project at Trinity College.

Much of what you read here in this book has been co-created with undergraduate students in the seminar, or through independent research projects outside of class or during the summer months
Working with several collaborators, I am writing this book to untangle our thinking about schooling and housing boundary lines, as well as divergent efforts to challenge them.
Much of what appears in the book emerged from listening to students trying to make sense of these complex issues in my college classroom, my visits to K-12 schools and graduate schools, and many voices heard in courtrooms and community meetings.

Even my solo writing here has been created through classroom discussions with curious young people who ask questions about why things are the way that they are. . . how did we arrive at this point? And that's precisely where historical thinking matters. Even if you are focused on present-day policy issues, with an eye toward improving the future, you cannot move forward without knowing how you arrived at our present-day policy struggles.
