 Erasure of county government led to growth of local and state powers
	 Hartford County government was so weak that it was literally erased as political entity in 1960
Abolition of CT county government in 1960 bolstered its two dominant competitors: local town and state government. 
As the govt unit closest to the people, "The towns occupy an emotional place in the hearts and minds of New England citizens, and any threat to diminish their powers would have resulted in an opposition stronger than that which accompanies any seeming threat to so-called states' rights in the South." p20, Rosaline Levenson.

Lack of regional governance in education: (Robert: Separate town governance means separate tax systems mean differential funding of town schools exclusively for kids who parents cane afford to live in those towns. . . persisted through 1970s school finance reform)

	No county government; CT dissolved its county system in 1960, and no one noticed because it had almost no power.
	Regional planning agencies are not elected governments with tax authority
	Some regional entities do exist: the MDC for water, CT Transit (state or regional?)


Connecticut dissolved county government in 1960s
 and no one noticed, because the only meaningful governments were 169 towns and state government

CT has never had a strong regional government system
- CRCOG strengths and weaknesses
- CREC strengths and weaknesses




	Regional school districts permitted, but mostly appear in rural areas
	Separate schools, towns, police, fire, etc.
	"Metropolitan Hartford" is not clearly defined (show census maps over time)

2) Governance remained very local, not regional; in fact, CT dissolved counties

3) Metro Hartford is a made-up term. It has no official meaning, no official boundaries. But I'll continue to use it in this book 

4) There are some regional entities in CT, but not the norm.

This chapter refers to the "metropolitan Hartford region," even though there is no clear definition of what that means over time. There has been no single defintion of the metropolitan Hartford area over time, which reflects the fragmented nature of the policy debate. . . .In fact, the phrase "metropolitan Hartford region" deserves quotation marks because there is no official standardized designation of its boundaries, a fact that makes it historically interesting. Both local and US census definitions of the "Greater Hartford" or "metropolitan Hartford" or "Hartford SMSA" have changed over time, as a result of shifting demographics and economic connections. Even the boundary designating Hartford County officially ceased to have any significant meaning after 1960 vote to dissolve it. Today we have acronyms naming some relatively weak regional planning and administrative agencies -- the Capital Region Council of Governments (CRCOG) and the Capitol Region Education Council (CREC) -- but as the story will show, these currently have limited power. ...

(Refer to wealth or income chart by town, not map) The Connecticut Metropatterns report dispelled "the myth of the affluent suburban monolith" by illustrating how some suburbs face high levels of fiscal stress, based on the cost of educating their population of needy children relative to their local capacity to raise tax revenues.[^fn1]
