## Federal Lending and Redlining {#lending}
*by [Shaun McGann and Jack Dougherty](authors-and-contributors.html)*

Racial and economic segregation in American housing was not simply caused by the prejudices of individual property owners. In addition, segregation was systematically institutionalized by governmental public policies that were designed to make it more affordable for White families to purchase newer homes away from central cities and in the suburbs. This chapter focuses on the 1930s Depression, when U.S. federal agencies collaborated with banks and other lenders to bolster the economy by expanding the availability of long-term loans to purchase homes, known as mortgages. Specifically, the chapter compares how two federal lending programs---the **Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC)** and the **Federal Housing Administration (FHA)**---carried out their respective missions, and their long-term consequences for metropolitan America. Both HOLC and FHA instituted ratings systems that downgraded neighborhoods based on the demographics of their residents---such as the presence of Black, immigrant, or impoverished families---rather than assessing value solely on the physical condition of the property. Both HOLC and FHA contributed to what we today call **redlining**: discrimination by refusing to provide or charging higher rates for financial services, such as home mortgages or insurance, due primarily to the location of a property, typically in neighborhoods where people of color and lower-income families reside. While government involvement in the private lending market prevented millions of families from being forced out of their homes, and expanded homeownership to millions more, eligibility to participate in these programs was not neutral, and federal funds promoted racial and economic discrimination.[@freundColoredPropertyState2007] Looking back at these 1930s programs reveals the thoughts and actions of public officials and private real estate interests, who together drew lines that intensified racial and economic segregation in metropolitan Hartford and other regions that continues today.

"Redlining" was coined decades after the Depression [TODO: by community organizers?] in the late 1960s, and has experienced a resurgence in recent decades. ["Redlining" momentarily arose during a 2020 debate among Democratic presidential candidates - TODO cite]. Credit belongs to authors such as Ta-Nehisi Coates [check spelling and mention and cite article], Richard Rothstein [mention and cite book], and [1619 project?] who reconnected this history to present-day policy debates, such as public and private disinvestment in cities. But as the origins of redlining have become popularized, important distinctions between these 1930s federal programs have become blurred. The latter portion of this chapter draws on recent works by historians Amy Hillier, as well as [insert names] Michney and Winling, to revise common misunderstandings. Although the HOLC color-coded "redlining" maps provide the most visually striking portrayal of discrimination in government policy, the FHA created more powerful and enduring tools of segregation through its more bureaucratic *Underwriting Manual*, which have had far more influence in shaping the lines that have divided us over time. For this reason, this chapter presents direct evidence from both HOLC and FHA to help us understand relative differences between them.

From Mapping Inequality intro: "In the 1980s discovery of the HOLC security maps changed the way historians thought about HOLC and New Deal housing policy. Housing activists in the 1960s and 1970s had criticized and protested discrimination in real estate lending and buying, coining the term “redlining” to illustrate the geographic dimensions of housing discrimination. Historian Kenneth Jackson found the maps in the National Archives, stating in his award-winning book Crabgrass Frontier that HOLC “devised a rating system that undervalued neighborhoods that were dense, mixed, or aging,” and rather than creating racial discrimination, “applied [existing] notions of ethnic and racial worth to real-estate appraising on an unprecedented scale.” "]

Today, buying a home is one of the most important and complex financial arrangements that people enter into, if they can afford it and choose to do so. Homeownership has become a key step toward adulthood and essential part of "the American Dream." For readers who have not purchased a home, it requires some historical imagination to understand how *much more difficult* this transaction was a century ago. [TODO: To learn more about the process of buying a home, try out the "buying a home" simulation in teaching section, which I developed while teaching about housing policy to undergraduate students, to help them understand key concepts in past and present.]

#### How Federal Lending Changed Homeownership {-}

During the 1920s, purchasing a home was difficult for even middle-class Americans to afford because of the financial terms. Many banks typically offered home mortgage loans that placed the burden of risk on the borrower's shoulders, and required them to pay it back very quickly. Typical mortgages during the 1920s included these terms:

- Large down payment: Typically 50 percent of the home value, because banks usually limited their mortgages to 50 percent (called a loan-to-value ratio of 50 percent).
- Short-term loans: Typically 5 years, designed to repay only the interest on mortgage loan.
- "Balloon payment" loans: Borrowers were required to repay the entire principal, or the amount borrowed, in one lump sum at the end of the loan period.
- Higher interest rates: Typically 6 to 8 percent during the 1920s.

During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the economic collapse devastated the housing market and threatened the interests of both lenders and borrowers. Homeowners who suddenly lost their jobs were now in danger of missing loan payments, defaulting on their mortgages, and losing their homes to bank foreclosures. But when banks foreclosed and attempted to sell off these homes, they typically were worth less than their original price prior to the Depression. In response to this economic crisis, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's "New Deal" administration created federal agencies that increased access to the middle class by offering home mortgages on more favorable terms:

- Smaller down payment: Typically 10 or 20 percent of the home value, because lenders raised the loan-to-value ratio to 80 or 90 percent.
- Longer-term loans: Repayment extended to 15 or 20 years.
- Amortization of loans: This formula meant that borrowers repaid both the interest and principal on the loan in regular installments over time, rather than one lump sum at the end.
- Lower interest rates: Federal support lowered interest rates to around 5 percent during the 1930s.

Picture how homeownership became more affordable for a buyer in the Hartford area, based on typical prices and mortgage terms during this period. Prior to the 1930s, if a home price was $10,000, a typical bank would only offer a $5,000 mortgage loan, limited to 50 percent of the home value, which forced the buyer to raise the remaining $5,000 in cash for the down payment at the time of purchase. If the buyer only had $2,000 on hand, they might need to make up the $3,000 difference by seeking a second mortgage from another lender, who would charge higher fees than the first mortgage lender due to the increased risk. During a five-year loan period, the homeowner would pay back interest to the bank on the first mortgage, but then need to raise funds for the $5,000 "balloon payment" at the end, which often required them to refinance a subsequent loan.

But during the 1930s, New Deal federal agencies provided mortgage loans with better terms for middle-class homebuyers in the Hartford region. In 1934, the *Hartford Courant* newspaper remarked that for a $10,000 home, a buyer needed only a 20 percent down payment of $2,000, because lenders raised the borrowing limit to 80 percent of the home value. The loan repayment period was extended from 5 years to 15-20 years. Buyers repaid the $8,000 principal plus interest through a series of stable monthly payments. According to an amortization calculator, the monthly repayments on an $8,000 mortgage at 5 percent interest for 20 years would be about $50 per month, very similar to monthly housing rental payments in Hartford at that time. No longer would "balloon payments" explode the homeowners' finances at the end of a short-term loan. For many Americans, as New Deal home loans programs improved these terms into the late 1930s, it became cheaper to buy than to rent.^[On national changes in home mortgage loan terms from the 1920s to the 1930s, see @jacksonCrabgrassFrontierSuburbanization1985, pp. 204-06. On Hartford changes, see @winslowHomePurchaseMade1934]  

#### How HOLC Rated Mortgage Risk {-}

One of Roosevelt's first steps to change mortgages was to sign legislation to create the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) in 1933. Historians Todd Michney and LaDale Winling describe how HOLC had two distinct phases. During its "rescue" phase (1933-35), HOLC purchased and refinanced loans for homeowners who were in danger of bank foreclosure due to their failure to keep up with existing mortgage payments or balloon payments. During its "consolidation" phase (1935-51), HOLC managed its mortgage holdings and sold them off to other investors. During this second phase, HOLC launched its City Survey Program and sent field agents to interview local banks and other lenders in 239 cities to assess mortgage investment risks. They conducted neighborhood-level appraisals and compiled data into confidential reports, which HOLC staff converted into color-coded maps, seen only by a small number of people at that time. While the federal government initially created HOLC to make home ownership more accessible to the middle class, these appraisals and maps also reflected the racism and elitism of the people who created them.^[@michneyNewPerspectivesNew2020]

Foster Milliken Jr., the HOLC field agent assigned to the Hartford area, was no stranger to the world of finance. Decades earlier, his father presided over Milliken Brothers, Inc., a multi-million dollar structural steel manufacturer in New York City that built the world's tallest buildings at that time. Prior to the Depression, Foster Milliken Jr. [TODO CHECK THIS: graduated from Amherst College,] then worked as a stockbroker in Manhattan and was familiar with its social circles. When HOLC sent him to Hartford in 1937, he consulted key figures in the city's home lending market---real estate board leaders, bank executives, and local administrators of federal housing loan programs---who he described as "a fair and composite opinion of the best qualified local people." But in his confidential report, Milliken described Hartford as a "typical New England city" with "ultra-conservative" fiscal policies, which preferred to avoid Roosevelt's New Deal federal programs whenever possible. "It is not surprising," Milliken wrote, that most of Hartford's conservative banking circle refused to accept HOLC funding (which required only a 20 percent down payment from lenders, far lower than their conventional terms) and "generally frowned upon" federal home lending programs. Nevertheless, several bank executives and real estate board members agreed to speak privately with Milliken and offer their assessment of neighborhoods in the City of Hartford and two suburbs, West Hartford and East Hartford. Milliken's report captured their collective views of the "trend of desirability" for each area, accompanied by four-color "Residential Security Map" to visually illustrate their perceived levels of mortgage investment risk. Green signaled the safest areas for lenders to offer home loans, followed by blue and yellow, and then red to mark the most "hazardous" areas. Years later, these became more widely known as "redlining" maps, as shown in Image \@ref(fig:1937-holc-hartford-map-scan).^[@homeownersloancorporationResidentialSecurityMap1937.

Standing in downtown Hartford's business district, Milliken observed that "the entire trend is to the west." Green, the highest rating, was most prominent in the northern half of West Hartford, and the northwest corner of Hartford around Prospect Avenue and Scarborough Streets. These marked the best opportunities for mortgage investment, what Milliken described as "hot spots" of new and well-planned home construction where "lenders with available funds are willing to make their maximum loans" at up to 80 percent of the appraised property value (thereby requiring only a 20 percent down payment from homeowners). Blue, the second-grade rating, stood out along Farmington Avenue from West Hartford Center into Hartford's West End, plus North End neighborhoods such as Blue Hills, and smaller pockets in the South End, as well as portions of East Hartford. Milliken stated that blue represented completely developed neighborhoods of good quality, but not the best, where lenders offered mortgages at no more than 70 percent of the home value (or a 30 percent down payment). Yellow, the third-grade ranking, dominated the southeast corner of West Hartford, most of the South End and large portions of the North End of Hartford, and the majority of East Hartford. Milliken indicated that yellow signified areas in "transition" where mortgage lenders were even more cautious than above. Finally, the lowest-grade red areas tended to be located near the flood-prone banks on both sides of the Connecticut River, such as Hartford's Front Street neighborhood, which now contained the least desirable housing.

A closer look at the HOLC map reveals striking patterns but also some variation across Hartford's city-suburban lines. When comparing the HOLC ratings of the land area evaluated in each municipality, 84 percent of West Hartford received an A or B, compared to 29 percent of Hartford and 5 percent of East Hartford, as shown in Table TODO # below. But the lowest ratings were not exclusive to the City of Hartford. In West Hartford, 16 percent of the rated land received a C, and the D rating was more prevalent in East Hartford (20 percent of all rated land) than Hartford (9 percent).^[TODO: Table based on geodata calculation of land area in HOLC map and report, 1937.

How did HOLC field agents rate neighborhoods? Although HOLC guidelines considered the physical condition and market price of the housing stock, field agents were instructed to evaluate the "social status of the population," based on the dominant standards of racial superiority and economic privilege at the time. The one-page standardized HOLC appraisal forms required Milliken to report the percentage of "Foreign-born" and "Negro" families in each neighborhood, as well as "Relief families" who received Depression-era federal income assistance. In the subsequent section asking about the "Infiltration" of outside groups, he occasionally listed "Italians" or "Mixed foreign" residents for selected city and suburban neighborhoods, as shown in Image \@ref(fig:1937-holc-inhabitants-c10).^[@homeownersloancorporationResidentialSecurityMap1937; TO DO: social status quote from 1937 page 1; see forms on pages A1-D3]

```

HOLC invited field agents to write additional comments at the bottom of the form, and Milliken's notes reflect his biases as well as those he likely heard from local bank and real estate leaders. In suburban West Hartford (map area Green A-2), one of the highest ratings was granted to a newer housing development that attracted "minor executives and businessmen." Milliken approvingly added that "a stream separates this section from its less desirable neighbor," referring to how Trout Brook served as a natural barrier to the adjacent southeastern area of West Hartford (Yellow C-2) which he described as having an "infiltration of mixed foreign" families in "workingmen's homes." In the North End of Hartford, Milliken favorably described the Blue Hills neighborhood (Blue B-5) but disapprovingly stated that it was "largely given over to the Hebrew race," meaning Jews had moved in, "although the better class Italians are now also moving there." In the South End of Hartford (Yellow C-9), Milliken observed that one nearly all-White neighborhood had a small percentage of "Negro families are confined to Roosevelt Street," and he added that "lenders suggest caution in the selection of loans." But all of these neighborhoods stood above HOLC's lowest-rated red areas, which Milliken described as "broader than the so-called slum districts" due to an "undesirable population" with "unstable incomes." Just north of downtown Hartford, Milliken labeled the Front Street neighborhood (Red D-1) as "the city's oldest residential section, which has gradually drifted into a slum area now mainly occupied by Negroes." See all of the HOLC neighborhood appraisals by clicking on the interactive map shown in Image \@ref(fig:1937-otl-redlining). Through the process of rating and mapping the Hartford region, the invisible color and class lines in the minds of Hartford's financial leaders were transformed into a visible color-coded map, endorsed by the federal government, yet hidden from public view.

How can we tell whether HOLC neighborhood ratings were driven primarily by physical housing characteristics, or by the discriminatory views of lenders and field agents about the people living there? Given that White elites segregated Black, immigrant, and lower-class residents into sub-standard housing, these two factors are tangled together. For example, one could argue that the neighborhood north of downtown Hartford received a Red D-1 rating not only because it had the greatest concentration of Black residents (66 percent), but also because it had the lowest-quality property (valued at only $4,000 - $6,000 per unit). Answering this question definitively is difficult because HOLC divided the Hartford area into only 27 neighborhoods, and only 3 of these included Black residents, so in statistical terms, this is a small sample size with limited variation.

While not a definitive method, we can assess the relative weight of these factors by comparing two Hartford neighborhoods that shared relatively similar physical housing characteristics, but received different HOLC ratings. Table TODO # below compares HOLC appraisal report data for two areas: the Blue Hills neighborhood in Hartford's North End (Blue B-5) versus the South End neighborhood (Yellow C-9). Both consisted primarily of two-family wooden frame homes, built within the previous two decades, which sold and rented at comparable prices in 1937. Why did HOLC grade one as a B and the other as a C? Demographic differences between the two neighborhoods are highlighted in bold type. The South End C-9 neighborhood contained more blue-collar factory workers, more foreign-born families, a very small but noticeable percentages of Black families, and "quite a few" more lower-income families who received government assistance. Once again, this side-by-side comparison of only 2 out of 27 HOLC ratings is not statistically definitive, but it certainly suggests that in the eyes of HOLC appraisers, the social composition of the neighborhood mattered more than the physical composition of the housing or its market value.^[TODO: UPDATE: See table data sources in @ilyankouMapFederalHOLC2017]

The Hartford region was only one of 230 [TO: check number] cities across the U.S. where field agents rated neighborhoods during the 1930s. Historians Robert K. Nelson and colleagues have compiled the most comprehensive digital collection of HOLC maps and appraisal reports at [Mapping Inequality: Redlining in New Deal America](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58), as shown in Image \@ref(fig:2018-redlining-america). Looking across HOLC reports, they found multiple instances of HOLC field agents stating that "infiltration" by various groups---such as "Colored" or "Italian" or "Jewish" or "Orientals", in the pejorative language used at that time---often "had a definitively adverse influence on neighborhood desirability" as seen through the eyes of the upper-class White representatives of the real estate industry.^[See "Introduction" in @nelsonMappingInequalityRedlining2016] Clearly, the HOLC maps and appraisals reflected the racist and elitist views of the people who created these documents.

#### How FHA Restricted Lending {-}

Shortly after Roosevelt's New Deal launched the HOLC, he signed the National Housing Act in 1934, which created a second agency that also reshaped home mortgage financing, called the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). While the HOLC directly offered mortgages to existing homeowners to rescue them from bank foreclosures, the FHA focused primarily on setting standards for new home construction, and guaranteeing that homebuyers would repay their loans to banks and other mortgage lenders. This system of guaranteeing loan repayment is a form of insurance, called underwriting. It signaled a major step by the federal government into the marketplace by using public tax dollars to subsidize the cost of mortgages by absorbing risks that would normally fall to privately-owned banks and other financial institutions, and was part of the New Deal administration's overall plan to restart the shattered housing market.

To decide which homebuyers qualified for an FHA-insured loan, the agency published its first *Underwriting Manual* in 1936. This detailed 260-page manual---which grew longer with subsequent editions---established guidelines for FHA staff to evaluate mortgage applications. Instructions specified exactly how FHA evaluators should inspect the property, its location, and the applicant's credit worthiness, before FHA examiners approved government funds to underwrite the loan and guarantee its repayment. The manual presented examples of scoring charts, which summarized various financial factors that FHA evaluators should consider, such as the ratio of the loan to the value of the home, and the likelihood that the building still would have economic value beyond the life of the mortgage. One of the most important factors on the form was "Location", and an unfavorable rating by FHA staff could cause the application to be rejected, as shown in Image \@ref(fig:1936-fha-manual-247).^[@federalhousingadministrationUnderwritingManualUnderwriting1936]

Concern over a home's location in the *Underwriting Manual* reflected the prevailing racial views of leading experts of this era, such as Frederick M. Babcock, the FHA Director of Underwriting. Babcock hailed from Chicago, Illinois, where he graduated from Northwestern University and worked in his father's real estate firm. While racism has a long history in White-dominated housing markets, scholars point to Babcock as the first to codify how race should be considered by the real estate industry in determining property values. In 1924, Babcock wrote his first book, *The Appraisal of Real Estate*, which observed that "Residential values are affected by racial and religious factors... A home utility seeks location near people, but always near persons of the same social standing, same races..." In 1932, Babcock delved further into this theme when writing his influential textbook, *The Valuation of Real Estate*. In a section titled "The Influence of Social and Racial Factors," he wrote that most population changes only lead to gradual differences in property value, then added: "But there is one difference in people, namely race, which can result in a very rapid decline." These declines in property values "can be partially avoided by segregation," Babcock wrote, and seemed to suggest that Southern methods for separating Whites and Blacks also would be appropriate in Northern states.^[@babcockAppraisalRealEstate1924, p. 71; @babcockValuationRealEstate1932, p. 91; On Babcock's role in codifying race and real estate, see @brownAppraisalNarrativesReading2018; @adamsPuttingRaceExplicitly2009; @BabcockFrederickMorrison2020; @harrisewingFrederickBabcockPhotograph1937]

Under the direction of Babcock and other FHA officials, the federal government financially rewarded racial segregation through its mortgage lending program, and defended White property owners against racial integration. The most direct language appeared in the "Protection from Adverse Influences" section, the factor carrying most of the weight in the "Location" category of the FHA *Underwriting Manual*, beginning in 1936 and continuing for many years. Evaluators were instructed to rate mortgage applications based on potential changes in the racial and social class demographics of the neighborhood. Overall, the FHA risk-rating system valued newly developed neighborhoods with homogenous White upper-class stability. Evaluators were instructed to "investigate areas surrounding the location to determine whether or not incompatible racial and social groups are present." Any intrusions would provoke "instability and a reduction in values," the *Manual* warned. If the "character of a neighborhood" declines, "it is usually impossible to induce a higher social class than those already in the neighborhood to purchase and occupy properties." Neighborhoods received higher scores if they were protected by "natural or artificially established barriers," such as public parks or college campuses, that prevented the "infiltration of business and industrial uses, lower-class occupancy, and inharmonious racial groups." Similarly, the guidelines cautioned that neighborhood schools "should not be attended in large numbers by inharmonious racial groups." The rating system also approved of restrictive deeds that prohibited "the occupancy of properties except by the race for which they are intended" for at least twenty years. In fact, when restrictive property covenants covered an entire housing development or neighborhood, the *Manual* judged them to be more effective than zoning ordinances, which municipalities may have adopted "with little or no real understanding of its purpose," as shown in Image \@ref(fig:1936-fha-manual-226). ^[@federalhousingadministrationUnderwritingManualUnderwriting1936, part II, sections 233, 229, 289, 284, 227-28.]

When the FHA expanded its *Manual* in 1938, it added a four-level ranking for the neighborhood location, on a scale from A to D, based largely on the HOLC City Security Map ratings. Updated FHA evaluation forms also included specific codes to designate the predominant racial composition of the neighborhood: White, Mixed, Foreign, and Negro, as shown in Image \@ref(fig:1938-fha-manual-1849).^[@federalhousingadministrationUnderwritingManualUnderwriting1938a, section 1849-50; TO DO: expand from Rothstein book]

While the HOLC program became less active as a mortgage lender during its consolidation phase (1935-1951), the FHA program grew during the Depression era by insuring mortgage repayments to lenders, thereby using public funds to cooperate with, rather than compete against, private enterprise. Since FHA guidelines favored newer construction in all-White areas, the federal government funded mass suburbanization outside of major cities. After World War II, the GI Bill created the Veterans Administration, which launched a closely related VA-guaranteed mortgage program to make it more affordable for returning soldiers and sailors to purchase their homes. While the discriminatory policies have been changed as a result of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, the FHA continues to exist today and currently insures mortgage repayments for over 8 million single-family homes.^[@jacksonCrabgrassFrontierSuburbanization1985, p. 206-07; @ @FederalHousingAdministration2020] 

#### Comparing the Impact of HOLC and FHA {-}

Although both of these New Deal mortgage programs---the Home Owners' Loan Corporation and the Federal Housing Administration---clearly illustrate the segregationist intent of the public officials who administered them, their impact in people in places such as the Hartford region were not identical. While the HOLC "redlining" maps visually capture our attention as stark evidence of government-sponsored discrimination, many readers are surprised to learn that HOLC did, in fact, offer mortgage loans to Black homeowners in "hazardous" neighborhoods, and in some cases at higher proportions than to White homeowners. By contrast, the discriminatory power of FHA-insured mortgage policy has been buried inside lengthy bureaucratic government documents such as the *Underwriting Manual*, which have not yet attracted similar levels of public attention, perhaps because the details are more difficult for novices to understand. The remainder of this chapter seeks to clearly lay out some of the key differences between the relative impact of HOLC versus FHA.

When Kenneth Jackson effectively launched the field of US suburban history with the publication of *Crabgrass Frontier* in 1985, he drew scholarly attention to the discriminatory practice of both the HOLC and the FHA mortgage programs. Jackson's book reprinted a sample HOLC "redlining" map in black and white, and pointed out how field agents and local bankers rated neighborhood investment risks based on the presence of "Negro" or "Jewish" residents.

RESTATE BROAD POINT: But as the origins of redlining have become popularized, important distinctions between these 1930s federal programs have become blurred. The latter portion of this chapter draws on recent works by historians Amy Hillier, as well as [insert names] Michney and Winling, to revise common misunderstandings. Although the HOLC color-coded "redlining" maps provide the most visually striking portrayal of discrimination in government policy, the FHA created more powerful and enduring tools of segregation through its more bureaucratic *Underwriting Manual*, which have had far more influence in shaping the lines that have divided us over time.


While some lenders avoided the third- and fourth-grade areas, Milliken's report was cautious to avoid implying that good mortgage investments could not be made there. Rather, "we do think [mortgages] should be made and serviced [but] on a different basis than in the First and Second grade areas." In this way, the HOLC did not refuse to offer loans in the "redlined" areas, but acknowledged that this practice existed among some lenders, and justified doing business differently in these areas.^[TODO: quotes from 1937 report, p. 1; pp. 3-4]

From Mapping America: "Mapping with geographic information systems (GIS) and quantitative statistical methods from the social sciences, scholars including Amy Hillier and James Greer have countered Jackson’s initial assessment. Some African Americans did gain access to HOLC financing, and a neighborhood rating was neither a blanket guarantee nor proscription for New Deal aid—“C” and “D”-rated neighborhoods often received more mortgages than nearby “A” neighborhoods."

Conclusions about Homeownership and HOLC in Hartford

- Homeownership rates increased for all Americans during the New Deal era... [data] but they increased at a higher rate for Whites compared to Blacks ...[data]

- In the City of Hartford, the Black single-family homeownership rate was around 6 percent in 1940, about half the rate of White homeownership.
- The number of Black single-family homeowners in Hartford was small -- only 119 -- compared to over 7577 White single-family homeowners.
- But surprisingly, Black Hartford single-family homeowners were *more likely* than Whites to have HOLC mortgages (13% vs 7%), relative to the population of homeowners. Although these numbers are very small (5 Black-owned HOLC mortgages vs 160 White-owned HOLC mortgages), this pattern of Black accessibility to HOLC, given low rates of homeownership, matches national trends.
- Overall, HOLC was not the primary mortgage lender for single-family homes in 1940s Hartford region. That was savings banks.... (calc this)
- The real power of HOLC mortgages was found in the suburbs

The 1930s HOLC maps were marked "confidential" for several decades, until community organizers and academics discovered and renamed them as "redlining" maps in the late 1960s and '70s.The frequency of this phrase jumped upward in full-text databases of published books after the 1970s. Ken Jackson's popular history of suburbanization, *Crabgrass Frontier*, called public attention to the discriminatory language of field agents' reports. He and others pointed to what they saw as a clear pattern of assigning the lowest "red" rating to neighborhoods with high concentrations of African-American residents.^[TODO: Check "confidential" marking; check Jackson notes on discovery; insert quote from @jacksonCrabgrassFrontierSuburbanization1985; decide about adding Google Books Ngram, https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=redlining&year_start=1940&year_end=2000 ]

But the story may not be as simple as Jackson suggests.

Some of the most insightful research on the federal government's role in the lending market comes from Amy Hillier's spatial analysis of Philadelphia sources, and her key distinction between the HOLC and FHA programs. The Philadelphia HOLC map covered a large number of neighborhood appraisals, which Hillier plotted on a digital map of census data. Through spatial regression modeling, she found that the racial composition of neighborhoods was a significant predictor for HOLC ratings in Philadelphia, while controlling for differences in housing characteristics. On the surface, this confirms that HOLC maps systematically downgraded Philadelphia neighborhoods due to race, which we could not prove in the smaller Hartford region.^[@hillierRedliningHomeOwners2003]

But Hillier conducts a second, more direct test of the historical evidence, to find out which neighborhoods actually received HOLC or FHA loans, since actual lending patterns matter more than stated intentions. For a sample of Philadelphia mortgage documents from 1940 to 1960, she matched the home address to her digital map and recorded the type and interest rate. Surprisingly, HOLC actually made a large proportion of its loans to lower-grade areas. This finding challenges the conventional "redlining" thesis by pointing out that HOLC has two stories, which are somewhat contradictory. On one hand, Hillier observes, "HOLC created security maps in which race was used to signify race levels." But on the other hand, "HOLC provided assistance to a million homeowners, across race and ethnicity, who were desperate to save their homes," including many to African-Americans and immigrants in the lowest-rated red areas.^[@hillierSearchingRedLines2005; TODO: CHECK  (Hillier JUH 2003, 394; Hillier Soc Sci Hist 2005, p227; Hillier SSH 2005 p209, see Hiller 2003b)]

By contrast, FHA loans were less common in Philadelphia's lower-rated neighborhoods, though limitations in the evidence prevents Hillier from making a more definitive claim. Overall, when considering both direct and indirect evidence, Hillier concludes that the FHA "reflected an anti-urban and racial bias deeper than the HOLC's," because its *Underwriting Manual* and other materials directed evaluators not to lend to low-rated areas, while HOLC reports consistently stated that loans could be profitable there. Although the HOLC "redlining" maps were not as influential as previous historians may have believed, the FHA is the primary culprit responsible for federal divestment and segregation that led to post-war urban decline.^[TODO: check "prevents" in Hillier PA History 2003; Hillier p414 JUH 2003]

We do not know whether Hillier's claims about HOLC and FHA lending patterns also hold true for the Hartford region, because no one has yet uncovered and examined the evidence. In any case, both the FHA Manual in general, and the HOLC report and map on Hartford in particular, reveal the upper-class white supremacy state-of-mind by federal agent Foster Milliken Jr. and the city's banking and real estate elite of the 1930s.
