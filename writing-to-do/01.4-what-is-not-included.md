There's a great deal of terrain that On The Line does not address, which leads me to warn readers in advance to look elsewhere. If you desire a more comprehensive history of public education in the state, see Christopher Collier's Connecticut's Public Schools: A History, 1650-2000, a wonderful and weighty book (XXX pages), or read my published review\[ LINK to text of my book review in sideline\] that attempts to summarize its key points in YYY pages. For a recent edited volume on the history of the Hartford metropolitan area, see ZZZ by Chen and Bacon\[ Link to Google Books\], or an updated version of my chapter\[ Link to my chapter in sideline\] that appeared within it, which served as a preview chapter for an earlier version of On The Line. Or if your interests are broader than this Hartford regional case study, look toward Thomas Sugrue's outstanding overview, Sweet Land of Liberty: The Forgotten Struggle for Civil Rights in the North.
Similarly, if you're searching for an insider's ethnographic study of life inside Hartford's city and suburban schools and neighborhoods, you will not be satisfied with what appears in the pages of this book, which only skims the exterior surface. Instead, take a look at Susan Eaton's\[ CHECK my description\] The Children in Room E4, which interlaces the Sheff v O'Neill school desegregation lawsuit with the story of one boy, Jeremy, who attends a relatively high-scoring yet racially isolated Hartford public school. . .  It's a well-crafted advocacy narrative, the one book I've assigned that my students tell me they could not stop reading, even during their spring break. Furthermore, consult the more in-depth legal studies of the Sheff case and related issues that have appeared in several legal journals. \[ CITE best ones\] And elsewhere, there exist more richly detailed analyses of school finance reform and metropolitan regionalism policy\[ Cite something on CCJEF for school finance, and cite Myron Orfield's CT Metropolitics as local report on issues in his broader books, cite also\].
