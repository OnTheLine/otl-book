When the carving up of town borders finally ceased in 1920, the relatively small state of Connecticut had been subdivided into 169 local town governments. But not all were content with the contours of the political map. After West Hartford separated from Hartford in 1854, residents on both sides of the line debated whether to merge the former "West Division" back into the city. One annexation proposal arose in 1895, shortly after West Hartford began to emerge as a "streetcar suburb," with the introduction of trolley lines that made downtown commuting much more feasible, and an economic boom in the construction of larger, more expensive homes. Annexation supporters focused on the high taxes and lack of services in West Hartford, particularly in the more affluent east side neighborhood that shared a border along Prospect Avenue with the city's West End. But farmers living in the western half of West Hartford rallied to defeat this measure.[footnote]Elizabeth Sweetser Baxter, <em>The Centennial History of Newington, Connecticut</em> (Newington, CT: Lucy Robbins Welles Library, 1971); "Annexation Bill Rejected by House,” <em>Hartford Courant</em>, March 21, 1925, http://search.proquest.com/hnphartfordcourant/docview/553948362/abstract/1004F5FC89AB4EB7PQ/12?accountid=14405; “Annexation of Elm Hill Is Agitated: Petition Circulated to Secure Sentiment of Residents --Maple Hill May Be Included Newington,” Hartford Courant, May 15, 1927, http://search.proquest.com/hnphartfordcourant/docview/557364020/abstract/1004F5FC89AB4EB7PQ/16?accountid=14405; “Annexation Favored In Newington: Maple Hill and Elm Hill Residents Vote Approval of Plan to Join New Britain,” <em>Hartford Courant</em>, November 26, 1930, http://search.proquest.com/hnphartfordcourant/docview/557917194/abstract/1004F5FC89AB4EB7PQ/2?accountid=14405; “New Britain Takes First Step In Plan For Annexations: Mayor Authorized to Name Committee to Negotiate With Towns,” <em>Hartford Courant</em>, February 19, 1931, http://search.proquest.com/hnphartfordcourant/docview/557959785/abstract/1004F5FC89AB4EB7PQ/4?accountid=14405; “Newington Legislator Dead At 64: George W.

Again in the 1920s, Hartford's most prominent business leaders advanced proposals for annexation, with support from suburban allies. During their initial 1922 campaign, the Chamber focused primarily on annexing West Hartford's east side neighborhood, home to some of the city's wealthier businessmen. W.L. Mead, a former newspaper editor, outlined the Chamber's argument that money which had been earned inside the city was unfairly moved across the border to suburbs that reaped its benefits, yet did not pay for Hartford's infrastructure. When Connecticut collects taxes from Hartford businessmen who reside in West Hartford, the state redirects the city's revenue to the suburbs. "By drawing an imaginary line," Mead suggested, "this [tax revenue] would reach Hartford, where it morally belongs." Mead believed that consolidation of the city and suburb was inevitable. "The best interests of Hartford and West Hartford are wrapped up in the greater city and the bringing together of the two towns under the same municipal government., it would seem, cannot be delayed infinitely," he concluded.[footnote]“West Hartford’s Annexation Will Be Recommended,” <em>Hartford Courant</em>, August 8, 1922, http://search.proquest.com/hnphartfordcourant/docview/557093317/abstract/9EA85A45E6224EADPQ/3?accountid=14405.[/footnote] But West Hartford political leaders, particularly those affiliated with the local Republican Party, sharply criticized the annexation plan. "The proposal originates with Hartford, not with West Hartford," noted State Representative Huntington Meech, who added that it would be "a mighty good business proposition for the city, which would get a small area, thickly populated, well developed, with improvements all in."[footnote]“Willing to Fight Ceding East Side of West Hartford: Representative Meech Would Accept Renomination by Republicans Expects Issue to Come up in Assembly Annual Loss of 5,000 in Taxes to Town Involved, He Says,” <em>Hartford Courant</em>, August 19, 1922, http://search.proquest.com/hnphartfordcourant/docview/557093626/abstract/9EA85A45E6224EADPQ/2?accountid=14405.[/footnote] Meech and other West Hartford residents refused to hand over the wealthier and more established portion of their suburb, and they prevailed in a public referendum and in the state legislature.

Despite this initial defeat, the Hartford Chamber of Commerce launched a bolder campaign in 1925 to "bring West Hartford back home." In response to past criticism that Hartford tried to steal away the wealthier east side of the suburb, the Chamber advanced its new proposal to annex the entire town—both developed neighborhoods and undeveloped farmland—into the city. Moreover, the Chamber submitted its annexation bill to the state legislature with the backing of twenty of the most prominent business leaders, including residents of both the city and the suburb. The "back home" campaign was backed by Louis Butler, president of Traveler's Insurance and Samuel Store, president of Colt's firearms manufacturing (two of the nation's largest companies in their industries) and Samuel Ferguson, the president of Hartford Electric Light and also a West Hartford resident. The annexation bill also received a strong endorsement from the <em>Hartford Courant</em>, the Republican-leaning newspaper based in a heavily Democratic city. "The interest of both Hartford and West Hartford would be best served by a return of the situation prevailing prior to 1854 when West Hartford was set off from the city," read the <em>Courant </em>editorial, noting that there was simply "no just ground for opposition to the bill" that the wisest and most experienced business leaders supported. Yet suburban leaders strongly disagreed and successfully blocked these annexation efforts. The Hartford-West Hartford boundary remained unchanged.[footnote]The Chamber of Commerce, “Formal Steps For Bringing West Hartford ‘Back Home,’” <em>Hartford</em> 10, no. 4 (January 1925): 1, 4, 14.“Editorial: Hartford and West Hartford,” <em>Hartford Courant</em>, April 28, 1925, http://search.proquest.com/hnphartfordcourant/docview/553973807/abstract/9EA85A45E6224EADPQ/4?accountid=14405.[/footnote]

Similar annexation debates rose—and fell—in other towns, sometimes motivated by suburban aspirations to improve local education by joining forces with more established city public school systems. In Newington, a rapidly growing streetcar suburb, located on Hartford's southern border, annexation advocates sought to make a deal with a larger urban neighbor during the mid-1920s to gain better services at a lower property tax rate. While Newington's center district briefly considered merging with Hartford, residents of the suburb's western neighborhoods actively lobbied to be annexed by the adjacent City of New Britain. But neither of these proposals survived in the state legislature. By 1930, Newington's population had doubled over the past decade to about 4,500 residents, but the town still lacked its own high school. That year, residents from the town's Elm Hill and Maple Hill neighborhoods voted in favor of annexation with New Britain by a margin of 200 to 7. Some of these suburban families most likely already sent their children to high school in New Britain, with costs subsidized by a state grant for rural communities without high schools. New Britain was the home of Connecticut Normal School, the first teacher training college in the state. The proposed merger had benefits for both sides. Suburban Newington families would receive access to New Britain's better school facilities, as well as fire and police protection, reportedly at a lower tax rate. In return, New Britain would benefit from millions of dollars in taxable property and also gain access to Newington's station on the New Haven railroad line. In 1931, New Britain's mayor arranged to negotiate the terms of a partial annexation with leaders from Newington and three other towns: Southington, Plainville, and Berlin. But suburban opponents to annexation killed the bill in the state legislature. In 1933, Newington's Republican leaders finally agreed to build their own high school, and accepted federal Public Works Administration funds from the Roosevelt Administration to achieve this goal, rather than redraw their boundary line.[footnote]Elizabeth Sweetser Baxter, <em>The Centennial History of Newington, Connecticut</em> (Newington, CT: Lucy Robbins Welles Library, 1971); "Annexation Bill Rejected by House,” <em>Hartford Courant</em>, March 21, 1925, http://search.proquest.com/hnphartfordcourant/docview/553948362/abstract/1004F5FC89AB4EB7PQ/12?accountid=14405; “Annexation of Elm Hill Is Agitated: Petition Circulated to Secure Sentiment of Residents --Maple Hill May Be Included Newington,” Hartford Courant, May 15, 1927, http://search.proquest.com/hnphartfordcourant/docview/557364020/abstract/1004F5FC89AB4EB7PQ/16?accountid=14405; “Annexation Favored In Newington: Maple Hill and Elm Hill Residents Vote Approval of Plan to Join New Britain,” <em>Hartford Courant</em>, November 26, 1930, http://search.proquest.com/hnphartfordcourant/docview/557917194/abstract/1004F5FC89AB4EB7PQ/2?accountid=14405; “New Britain Takes First Step In Plan For Annexations: Mayor Authorized to Name Committee to Negotiate With Towns,” <em>Hartford Courant</em>, February 19, 1931, http://search.proquest.com/hnphartfordcourant/docview/557959785/abstract/1004F5FC89AB4EB7PQ/4?accountid=14405; “Newington Legislator Dead At 64: George W.

**************


Chapter argument:
Like many states, Connecticut experienced dramatic suburban population growth during the twentieth century
But unlike other areas, Connecticut's cities did not expand their territory through annexation.
Suburban residents fought to keep their nineteenth-century boundary lines intact
Result is a state divided into 169 separate town governments...

SECTION OUTLINE
	Suburbanization moved population in twentieth century (animated dot map)
	Several factors drove suburbanization, such as highway decisions and job migrations (overlays?), white flight and urban rebellion (in chapters)
	But this book argues that housing and schooling relationship drove suburbanization more than either one alone
	While population and wealth expanded, governance system largely did not, because suburbs successfully fought annexation



Suburbanization happened as population spread outward and created metro areas, but governance system remained very local, not regional.

1) Suburbanization happened. . .

Housing and schooling were not the only factors

FOOTER


 A regionalist approach to public education might have made sense in Greater Hartford as late as 1920s, given other regional entities already in place or in creation. At minimum for secondary schooling. . . But it did not happen. In fact, opposite occurred. Planning for sewers, not schooling.

In 1927, after several failed attempts by Hartford to annex the town of West Hartford, an alternative proposal arose for a regional planning agency, initially called the Greater Hartford Commission, but later named the Metropolitan District Commission.


Early observers heralded the plan. . . According to Burbee In 1928 "It is a fitting approach to the tercentennial of the Constitution Towns, divided and redivided since 1635, that a movement has been inaugurated to bring parts of them back into closer union, each of course retaining its independence but all united in a 'metropolitan district' as to their common interests." p860

But this Hartford regional planning agency only happened because its scope was narrowly defined.
Originally -- 
	General Assembly considered regional commission, as long as no annexation, and vote to join by town residents Murphy p207; Charles Goodwin chaired panel in 1928. Goodwin "believed that the water, sewage, health, street paving, building inspections and zoning functions for the people of the capital area could be much better handled on a regional basis" 	But this "super agency" (author's phrase) was "just too big for the average person to accept" and disagreements over differences in streets, zoning, etc. 	State legislature narrowed the regional plan "By the endof March 1929, the only things left were water supply, sewerage, highlyways (to a small degree) and regional planning. The health work would not be taken from the otnws, nor would zoning issues" no electrical services Murphy p208
Regional schooling never even made it onto the table. . . .

Members of the West Hartford town council were highly skeptical of any regional planning proposal, fearing that it was a covert move toward annexation by the city, which leading officials had opposed for decades.
	"Flatly denying that he was interested in the annexation of west Hartford by Hartford and stating definitely that he was emphatically opposed to any such movement, Benedict M. Holden appeared before the West Hartford town council last night by special invitation, to defend his proposal for a Greater Hartford commission appointed by the governor to study the common problems of water supply, sewage disposal, and zoning."
	WH town council members believed Holden "evaded the issue" and some felt this was "a covert move toward eventualy annexation"
	Holden: "The bill has absolutely nothing whatever to do with annexation of West Hartford. Why it's foolishness toeven consider briging West Hartford into Hartford. It won't happen within the next fifty years, you can depend on that."
	Instead, Holden told WH council that (indirect quote) "towns were so closely interwoven in interests with each other and so interdependent that the responisilbity and problems of one were equally shaed by all the others"
	Holden: "If there is an epidemic of typhoid in Newington, it will close the schools of West Hartford. If the water of Hartford is contaminated, your children who work in the offices of our city will be poisoned when they drink it. We've got to work together"
“Annexation Plan Denied By Holden: West Hartford Council Hears Explanation of Proposed Legislation Which Disturbs Town,” Hartford Courant, March 16, 1927, http://search.proquest.com/hnphartfordcourant/docview/557425274/abstract/FC5BD7959D7649C6PQ/1?accountid=14405.

West Hartford leaders also expressed skepticism about the MDC as a possible school takeover, offering the first hints of possible superiority over city schools. . . .
Public hearing by Cities and Boroughs Cmte at legilslature
Benedict M Holden spoke in favor of a Greater Hartford Commission (5 reps from Hartford, 4 from West Hartford, to be named by governor, to proposed charter for voters of H and WH would later act; not an annexation measure, he says
Aubrey L. Maddock of WH opposes plan, and says "Holden "neglected to mention the school question," adding that some day Hartford may have consolidated schools, "when it will have more to offer West Hartford than it has today."
Deputy Sherriff Charles E Lord, a WH town council member, opposes annexation: "West Hartford does not want to send children 'to such a school sysem as you have here,' and that he knows of instancees in which residents of hartford are attempting to provide for the entrance of their children to West Hartford schools" 1927-03-16-HC W. Hartford Still Opposes
At this time, WH residents did not claim their schools to be superior to Hartford, and certainly could not do so at the secondary level, and HPHS reigned supreme. . .. But they expressed doubts about Hartford's failure to consolidate all of its smaller districts into one citywide district, as the 1909 state law required, with time delay for Hartford.


In November 1929, voters in the City of Hartford and four adjacent towns (Bloomfield, Newington, Wethersfield, and Windsor) approved the referendum to join the Metropolitan District Commission. But East Hartford pulled out before the referendum. West Hartford voters rejected the referendum, and instead relied on prior reservoir sharing arrangements. The town finally decided to join the MDC five decades later in 1984. (Murphy 208-09)
Kevin Murphy, Water for Hartford: The Story of the Hartford Water Works and the Metropolitan District Commission (Middletown: Wesleyan University Press, 2010), https://books.google.com/books?id=oud2Zgjwus4C.


The MDC took over responsibility for Farmington Valley reservoir system for delivering clean drinking water in 1930, and it built the first major sewage treatment plant in Hartford's South Meadows, to reduce direct dumping of raw sewage into the Connecticut River, in 1938. Regional governance succeeded for water and sewer lines, but not for educating schoolchildren.


USE at TOP or BOTTOM: A regionalist approach to public education might have made sense in Greater Hartford as late as 1920s, given other regional entities already in place or in creation. At minimum for secondary schooling. . . But it did not happen. In fact, opposite occurred. Planning for sewers, not schooling.
