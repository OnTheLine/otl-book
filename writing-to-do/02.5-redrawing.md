Redrawing Lines around Hartford, 1890s-1930s

Today\[ 

SECTION OUTLINE:
- Into the early 1900s, school district lines did not necessarily follow the borders of town governments; Union schools
-1909 state law by Trinity President Flavel Luther redefined school districts along town lines; not a highly newsworthy story, but mostly framed as consolidation of small urban districts; not fully implemented until 1930s
- A century later, this 1909 law cited in the Sheff opinion as key act that led to segregation and inequality in Sheff case
- But no racial motivation at the time; Instead, motivation was fiscal consolidation and saving money\] we are accustomed to a sharp division between city and suburban school districts. 
In most the Hartford metropolitan area. . . school district is identical to town boundaries. . . Hartford . .  . suburb. . each operates their own school district. (In very rural areas where student population is low, some towns have formed regional school districts. . .)
Families like mine go shopping for homes with a strong sense that the private residence they purchase will entitle them to attend a designated public school. 
School districts hire investigators to patrol their borders and force out non-resident students. 
	Inside each suburban district, if there are multiple schools at each grade level, then students are assigned to a school attendance area based on their residence. 
people pay money to get into the right school district, and in some cases into the "right" school attendance area.
If an existing school becomes overcrowded, or a new school is constructed, the local school board typically will propose to redraw these school attendance lines (a process commonly known as redistricting, although it only affects the district's interior attendance boundaries).  
In some suburban districts, redistricting debates draw large crowds of anxious parents who desperately want to protect what many call their "neighborhood school." These battles usually occur within the town boundaries, as scarcely anyone today proposes to redraw the exterior lines that separate the city school district from each suburban district.






	But over a century ago, Connecticut's school district borders looked very different that what we see today. 
1) Until the early 1900s, in many parts of Connecticut, each school was its own district, with elected board members and finances to support one school. This very localized system was expensive. Advocates of school consolidation demanded to shift from a "district-system" to the "town system," where a centralized school boards would hire one superintendent would oversee all of the public schools in the town. 

Through the early 1900s, students routinely crossed over lines to attend public schools located outside of their town of residence, for two reasons:
1) school districts that overlapped town boundaries
2) cross-district agreements to educate high school children from rural towns that did not have their own secondary schools
Yet all of this began to change when Connecticut legislators approved a 1909 law that sharply redefined these blurry boundaries by requiring school districts to follow the same borders that separated Hartford from its nascent suburban towns. These policy decisions to sharply define school districts to be identical to town boundaries, originally viewed as a Progressive-era policy to bring order to a somewhat chaotic system, eventually became the crux of a civil rights school desegregation lawsuit filed eight decades later. 

Lines that divided city and suburban school districts  were much blurrier and less defined than those of today. School zone boundaries sometimes stretched across city-suburban municipal borders. Students regularly attended public high schools in towns outside of their residence.

Look closely at Hartford area school district maps of late 1800s/early 1900s and two things will stand out:
a) inside each city and town are several smaller neighborhood school districts; these are not simply attendance zones; each of these operated as a legally independent district, board, taxing authority, etc [see Collier testimony]
b) "Union School" districts that crossed over town boundaries: see West Hartford-Hartford and Hartford-Bloomfield examples below

state and local school leaders who consolidated a patchwork of very local school districts, where students commonly attended public schools across town lines, to a consolidated and more rigid system where individual municipalities became more responsible for educating youth within their town boundaries. Political actions and legal decisions in the early twentieth century set into motion a popularized belief that school district boundaries were fixed/permanent/sacred, feeding the “home rule” mythology (Collier) in Connecticut minds. . .

the Connecticut legislature sought to bring order to a haphazard public school system in 1909,\[ FIND text or image of 1909 law to include in the book\] by mandating that school districts follow municipal boundaries. It also explains local reluctance to follow this state mandate and why it was not fully implemented until the 1930s



Collier recounts the state's long-running dispute over consolidation; in the 1840s, Henry Barnard, the state's first secretary of education (and later the first US Commssioner of ed) called for small rural neighborhood districts, some with less than a dozen students, to be consolidated into larger ones, but little changed; (chapter 4)  In the 1850s, the CT legislature granted towns the authority to abolish or consolidate tiny neighborhood school districts, of which there are 1,626 across 153 towns; some rural neighborhood districts had less than a dozen students, while urban disricts had over a thousand p251-2; Local opponents of consolidation objected to transporting children farther away from homes; and loss of control over very local schools to the town government; Reports of substandard education pointed to dilapidated one-room schoolhouses with inexperienced schoolteachers. yet few towns voluntarily consolidated their tiny districts into a town-wide school p253 "The word 'consolidation' is odious," acknowledged Charles Hine, the state Commissioner of Education, in 1884, and politicians were reluctant to interfere with local control; (Hine cited in Collier 254)

note 10 - scores of union districts in late 1880s

Yet the consolidationists finally prevailed in 1909 when the legislature overwhelmingly passed a bill that redrew school district lines to be identical to town boundaries; authority over local schools from the neighborhood district to the town government, who would elect school board members and collect local property taxes and to receive a supplemental state grant;

TEXT of 1909 bill on page 259;footnote 34: Statutes of 1910, chapter 146; reprinted in Report of Board of Ed 1910, p16-17;

When the legislature finally passed the 1909 bill, consolidation was no longer controversial; Scarcely any coverage in the July 1, 1909 Hartford Courant (collier footnote 34, and see news); sentiment was driven by "the search for order," as historian Robert Wiebe has described this era;  in the Progressive government to bring order to chaos
also driven by demographic pressures, where rural townspeople were moving into cities for jobs, and lowering the population density in outlying areas, making rural schools less sustainable; p256; many districts that had not yet consolidated did so under this law; 259; The State Board of Education praised the results, namely improved schools and reduced taxes through economies of scale; 260;

Advocates of consolidation included Flavel Luther, Trinity College president who was elected to the CT State Senate for Hartford's first district, for two terms from 1906 to 1910. Luther was a Progressive-era Republican who arranged for his friend, former US president Theodore Roosevelt, to receive an honorary doctorate at Trinity in 1918. (Knapp 5, 217; check Blue Book, since Political Graveyard states one term, 1907-08)

Flavel Luther rose to the presidency of Trinity College as a trained mathematician, astronomer, and Episcoal minister. . . “a rare combination. . . of the technical man witht he man of general culture in the humanities” p127 Men of Mark in CT 
Norris Galpin Osborn, “Flavel Sweeten Luther, Jr.,” in Men of Mark in Connecticut: Ideals of American Life Told in Biographies and Autobiographies of Eminent Living Americans (W.R. Goodspeed, 1906), 125–29, https://books.google.com/books?id=ARFh_Sbpg84C&pg=PA125

Some holdouts and historical dispensations, such as Hartford, which was divided into two districts: the downtown incorporated city and the surrounding township. p259 (on p263 Collier says one large and several small districts in Hartford); in 1929, the Gen Assembly passed a measure to consolidate the capital city's remaining neighborhood districts into the town system, if voters approved. The referendum initially failed but eventually won approval, and finalized in 1934 p263; foonote 47: Arsenal School District vs Consolidated Town/City of Hartford, 120 Conn. 348 (1935) 350-364

But as historian Collier observes, "the consolidation of administration did not mean consolidation of students" p26, and one-teacher, one-room schools continued to survive; as of 1922 there were 647 one-room schools across the state, often with wood stoves for heat, and no indoor plumbing, some built during or shortly after the Revolutionary War; SEE ALSO map p268 from 1921, which may show more; SCAN Connecticut Schools 3 (Nov 1921); most typically grades 1-6
; by 1949 there were still 55 one-room schools (p267); Connecticut's last one-room schoolhouse, in New Milford, closed in 1967 (p. 266):



Disputes that did exist concerned transfer of taxable property and debt from old district system to new town system?

Historian Collier concludes that "consolidation of the state's schol distiricts elevated the quality of schoolin in Connecticut more than any institutional reform betwen 1650 and 2008," when he wrote his book (p263). Although ed opportunities between towns remained vastly unequal due to large differences in local property tax bases, particularly rural towns and wealthy cities, schooling inside CT's 169 boxes was improving








Link Sidenote: What's the difference between a school district versus a school attendance zone? [See note #] 
Design notes: sidenotes link to non-sequential text, located at end of chapter, and may be incorporated into rollover endnotes.
Sidenote: In this book, school district refers to the larger boundary that encloses the entire local education agency, while school attendance zones refer to the smaller boundaries, located inside each district, when students are assigned to attend specific schools by residence. Other terms are used elsewhere in the US, such as "catchment areas" as a synonym for attendanze zones. Also, these terms are used in confusing ways inside contemporary Connecticut. For example, a "redistricting" debate inside a local school district usually refers to proposals to redraw interior attendance zone boundaries, not the exterior boundary of the district. 
, some of these school district boundaries stretched across town lines, blending students from different municipalities that seems very strange to us today. (Hartford-WH-Bloomfield; Avon-Canton)
**CLARIFY HERE that Hartford consisted of about ten legally separate school districts, and show names on map
First, each town in the Hartford region had several smaller legally separate (check?) school districts inside its boundaries, rather than one school district for each town that we recognize today.

	 [Section argument:] Politically dominant leaders insisted on orderly reorganization of school districts with 1909 passage of school consolidation act. The law attempted to improve ed quality through economic scale, transforming tiny neighborhood districts into a system of larger boundaries. Over time, legislators declared that smaller neighborhood districts would be consolidated into one larger district, identical with the municipal boundary. Muncipal-level school consolidation eventually succeeded, but took thirty years until Hartford primary schools redrew and operated within new boundary lines,

Some of today's suburban towns that pride their separateness from the city were actually located within its boundaries during the mid-1800s. 
Central Connecticut was settled centuries ago. But if you overlay an historical map on top of today's geography, the shifts in boundary lines would surprise many, particularly suburban dwellers who would find themselves inside the city. (West Hartford - 1854 as Western district, etc.)


	 In today's eyes, CT boundary lines may seem to be permanent, but much fluctuation over time. Burbee 1928: "Constitution Towns, divided and redivided since 1635" p860; TO DO: Review transcript of Collier's trial testimony (14 Jan 1993, 2-80) and also "findings of fact" in court docs
	



	 In 1880s-90s, some school districts stretched across municipal boundaries between Hartford city and suburbs. Scholars (as they called students at that tiem) who lived in the west side of Hartford attended a school in the adjacent town of West Hartford. . .   Just north of the city, families living in the town of Bloomfield crossed the line and enrolled their children in city-based district. 
TO DO: Tracey Wilson mentioned 1860s WH records describing how school district boundaries stretched across municipal borders


	 Bringing order to blurry boundaries by 1930s \[ Robert suggests: Would be interested in learning more about 1909 law. Why? Who pushed this law? Callahan in "Cult of Efficiency" argues that early 20th century efficiency reforms responded to calls from white protestant elites for cutting costs of associated with growing public school rolls from European immigration. So there was a racial/ethnic dynamic to educational efficiency reforms in regards to Taylorism, etc.\]


	The initial boundaries of Hartford's cities and suburbs were not created with intentional racial (or social class?) divisions, but were soon utilized for this purpose by the next generation of leaders.


	 Trinity president Flavel Luther, who became state senator in 1906, was active organizer in school consolidation movement. "His work int he Senate is best remembered by the law which his committee put through for abolishing the school district system in the smaller towns and by the legislation necessary for the establishment of trade schools." p769, Burbee 1928 
The 1909 legislature attempted to consolidate (11?) separate elem? school boards and districts inside Hartford, into one city-wide entity. 
	 Why did Hartford consolidation not immediately succeed? "The attempt at consolidation in Hartford, previously recorded, had failed largely becaseu of fear of suspected political infection from some of the larger districts, and now there is the dread of the possibilities in the accumulating bonds of separate districts which the city would have to assume." Led to post-WWI era, major building projects, including school facilities in Hartford.  p837, Burbee 1928 [FIND MORE]


While the town system of school governance was approved by the state legislature in 1909, it was not fully implemented (esp in Hartford) until 1930s 

Joint Standing Committee Hearings, CT Gen Assembly 1911, Education
CSL Stacks, floor 3A
Wed Feb 8, 1911 S.J.R. 30 “Establishing a board of education for City of Hartford” p.149
Bill introduced by Senator Hooker
Bill substituted/revised at this point by Arthur L. Shipman:
-based upon New Haven board of education-taken almost verbatim from 1909 town consolidation
Hartford has been paying (since 1874) greatly varied taxes for school purposes (1.736 First District; 6.041 Northeast) p.150 “great disparity on property, and debt, and tax rate and enumeration and attendance as we have here…this talk of keeping school districts separate is to my mind a perfect absurdity.”
-Shipman lays down what implementation would have to look like for consolidation, which is necc because of such discrepancies.
p.152 “The old district lines were laid out when our forefathers were farming everything except a little plot bounded West by Main Street and East by the Connecticut River.”
-Board of Ed would perform all duties of district committees…and high school committee


	 Conflict between rural and urban towns (does this explain resistance to consol?)
	 Rural town interests dominated urban interests in Connecticut's early history, due to constitutional rules that granted two legislators to each town, regardless of population. For example, both X and Hartford had two seats 
	 Rural-urban, Republican-Democratic conflict
	 Given the prominence of urban education in 1900, many rural legislators created state educational aid policies to assist their outlying districts.
