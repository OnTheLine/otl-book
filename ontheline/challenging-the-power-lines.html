<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Jumping the Line</h2>
<p><em><a href="index.html#contributors">by Vianna Iorio, JiYun Lee, and Jack Dougherty</a></em></p>
<p>In 1984, Saundra Foster, a Black single mother living in Hartford, was searching for a better school for her teenage son, Trevor. She described him as “a good kid” who liked to go to school and learned some topics faster than other students, but ran into problems at Hartford Public High School, which in her view was “geared for special education.” Saundra explained that it was “almost impossible” to get Trevor into more rigorous classes, and he was turned down when he tried to raise the issue with his teacher. Trevor was then referred to the district’s alternative education center for students it deemed not suited for regular classrooms. Faced with this bleak prospect, Trevor considered dropping out of high school altogether. This was the breaking point for the Foster family, and Saundra knew she had to take immediate action. “For a child like that to say that he is contemplating dropping out of school, it’s time to start thinking about alternatives,” she later told a reporter.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Saundra Foster decided to “jump the line” by enrolling Trevor, a resident of the city of Hartford, in the suburban school district of Bloomfield, located immediately to the north. Registering her son to attend a public school outside of her legal residence, without permission, was a serious step; although many parents had done it before, her decision could interrupt his education if they were caught. Saundra decided on Bloomfield because he could live with his aunt, who legally resided in the district. Trevor transitioned well into Bloomfield High School by fall 1984 and even became a starting player in the boy’s varsity basketball team [Dave Drury, “Bloomfield Cracking Down on Non-Residents in Schools,” The Hartford Courant (1923-1986), March 21, 1985, <a href="http://search.proquest.com/hnphartfordcourant/docview/758745359/abstract/13A12CEBBF12C1F05D2/6?accountid=14405" class="uri">http://search.proquest.com/hnphartfordcourant/docview/758745359/abstract/13A12CEBBF12C1F05D2/6?accountid=14405</a>.]. There was no record of him getting in conflict with peers or teachers and Saundra believed “he was much better off in Bloomfield” (David Drury, “Bloomfield Police Seek Warrants for Non-Resident Students” March 21, 1985.) Although she had to live apart from her son, “jumping the line” was the right decision in her mind, because city-suburban school district boundaries were unjust. “I didn’t deal this deck of cards,” she later explained, “I just have to play them,” and her son Trevor “should be able to go where he can to get the best education” [Paul Bass, “Case on Residency and Schools Halted,” New York Times, June 9, 1985, sec. Connecticut Weekly, <a href="http://search.proquest.com/hnpnewyorktimes/docview/111144867/abstract/13A12D55A3C1001B800/2?accountid=14405" class="uri">http://search.proquest.com/hnpnewyorktimes/docview/111144867/abstract/13A12D55A3C1001B800/2?accountid=14405</a>.].</p>
<p>Saundra Foster, mother of Trevor Foster, was accused of stealing a public education from a district where she did not reside. Source: still frame from video, William Mendoza and Anita Ford Saunders, “Jumping the Line,” The Public File (Hartford, CT: WVIT Channel 30, August 31, 1985).</p>
<p>Suburban districts referred to non-resident students like Trevor Foster as “line jumpers,” and school officials usually took administrative action to “disenroll” them from the district. But this case was different. In April 1985, Bloomfield police arrested Saundra Foster and three other Black parents, and charged them with a first-degree felony for larceny. This highly-publicized action was unprecedented in Connecticut, and perhaps the nation, as no one in recent memory had been charged as a criminal for enrolling their child in a public school outside of their home district.[NOTE: The other three parents arrested were Elizabeth Brown of Hartford, Claude Johnson of Hartford, and Norma Wright of Windsor.] But Bloomfield town leaders were motivated by three factors. First, the school district’s average expenditure per pupil had risen to $4,000 in 1985, which in their eyes meant that the Fosters were “stealing an education.” Their decision to issue arrest warrants came in the early spring, just before town residents were asked to approve the next year’s school budget. Second, two of the four arrested families included young Black men on Bloomfield’s high-profile basketball team, and school administrators worried that their presence put their interscholastic sports titles at risk. Third, many White Bloomfield residents became increasingly anxious as Black students surpassed 50 percent of the high school enrollment in the early 1980s. Bloomfield leaders’ decision to introduce a felony charge clearly was designed as a scare tactic to discourage Black Hartford families from “jumping the line” into their racially transitional suburban school district. Moreover, town leaders adopted then-President Ronald Reagan’s racist “welfare queen” stereotype to specifically charge Black Hartford parents in the 1980s, but not White parents in prior years, with “stealing an education” from their suburban public school [Drury, “Bloomfield Cracking Down,” Drury, “2 City Parents are Charged [short version if already cited above?], Mendoza and Saunders, “Jumping the Line”].</p>
<p>While the arrests drew the public eye and may have intimidated some parents, they also sparked a civil rights debate on the growing disparity between city and suburban schools in metropolitan Hartford. Saundra Foster’s advocates and civil rights activists capitalized on her arrest to raise pivotal questions on one’s right to an education. Is it possible to “steal” a public education that the state is required to provide to all students? Did the growing inequality between Hartford and its suburbs prove that Connecticut was not meeting its constitutional obligations for equal educational opportunity? These questions were not just important in the abstract. The arrests forced a closer public examination of education inequity, which helped lay the groundwork for the landmark Sheff v O’Neill school integration lawsuit in 1989. City-suburban school district boundaries became increasingly contested during the 1980s due to a combination of the rising disparities between urban and suburban schools, increasing costs of public education, and rising white suburban barriers against non-resident students of color, in contrast to more relaxed policies towards non-resident white students a generation earlier. Building on increased public awareness from debate over the Foster arrest and other incidents, the Sheff plaintiffs went to court to challenge the legality of these boundary lines.</p>
